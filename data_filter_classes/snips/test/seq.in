Jeff , . Please check with Belden or I if you are going to use these curves for . anything other than internal analysis or high - level negotiating . . If you need help converting into quarterly numbers , let me know . . Remember that the total cost of wholesale power includes ancillary services . which you can estimated to be 5 % of these amounts . I . e . , 105 % of the curve . price is the average power cost including A / S . Alan

Hey Ben , . How is life in Texas ? Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC ? . He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn . Life has gotten rather boring . out here . We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off . . This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of . the routine has gotten mundane . We all live for port calls and push the . envelope of ethical billing while in port . I have been shot down by every . school I applied for . How about you ? They can all blow me as I would . probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs . That has been my . achilles heel . Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this . ship . . I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long . . There is nothing else to do except that in my free time . If I don't have a . goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land . The . summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit . people when I get back . Any plans to be in NY this summer ? . I have been messing around with stocks too . I have made only a little since . the tech crash . I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get . killed . See you in the summer . . CHOB

Mark : . Steve Kean has asked if we should send EnronOnline brochures to the various . poicy makers in D . C . As we discussed earlier , you did not want this to occur . until our electronic trading business was up and running . Please let me . know when you think we should be able to brief policy makers , if at all . In . any case , I'd certainly like to have some brochures on hand to be able to . answer any questions we get about the product . . An update on Blackbird and the situation regarding scrutiny of their . electronic trading product . . . . fortunately there was no correspondence . generated from Capitol Hill ( Combest or Ewing ) asking the CFTC to look more . closely at Blackbird's product or electronic trading in general . Upon . checking with Committee folks , they were satisfied that Blackbird has been . fairly straighforward in having an open dialogue with the CFTC . . . . Blackbird . has met with some of the Commissioners already and is meeting with Rainer . today to walk them through the product and show why its not something that . should be treated as an exchange . . Also FYI , Ewing's staff director at the subcommittee , Stacey Carey , is now . working for ISDA as a government affairs person . This should bode fairly . positively for Ewing's awareness and position on OTC derivatives issues , . although she is precluded by ethics rules from lobbying the subcommittee or . Ewing for 1 year . . Jeff . -

Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online . system . I wish I could tell you these are the final ( or even the most . recent ) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that . I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date . They do have the advantage of . being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today . I don't . think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as . starting points , please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest . material . . The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective . counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper . The first time the . counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password , it is required . to agree to the ETA ( Electronic Trading Agreement ) by clicking on an """" I . Agree """" box after scrolling through the agreement . The GTC's are the . contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master . agreement in place . Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty . to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary . While . most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our . """" Omnibus """" documentation , the weather derivatives look more like a """" Deemed . ISDA . """" One final complication , the credit group has asked us to create two . sets of documents : one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have . no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is . not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call . for collateral if we choose .

Group , . A quick reminder . The cell phones are for group member to group member usage . As such , calling between group members , and our 1 - 800 - 684 - 1336 number is free . We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters . Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month . Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month ! Group member to group member usage is approximately 45 - 90 minutes per month - and this is not calculated in the minutes used . If you want to use this phone as your only phone , let me know , and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you . . Thank you , . B

Jeff : . Professor Howard Stevenson ( Harvard Bus .

Are you interested in Enron's participation in the Case Study ? and would you be available for a brief meeting with Professor Stevenson - and possibly lunch ? . In my view , we need to refresh the Enron story being told through HBS Case Studies . The Dabhol Power Case ( still being used ) is dated and does not reflect our business strategy .

here's a revision to travis's draft for the private equity folks . . couple of comments for consideration at 2 : 00 : . 1 . we do not want to encourage a 338 ( h ) 10 election for basis reasons that are different than existed in Northern . . 2 .

I am not convinced we want to offer same conversion terms as we did Dynegy . Areas to think about removing or changing are ( i ) do we offer the makewhole and ( ii ) should we replace all """" repurchase """" scenarios with a redemption structure to avoid the whole change of control issue . . 4 .

Corry , Cara , . There are new versions have been released to stage . . What's new and what's fixed : . Pre - Schedule Workspace : . Now able to select a Trading Region / Desk ( EAST or WEST ) to separate path confirm records . . Confirm record creation should be significantly faster . Let me know if the speed is still unacceptable . . Issues with Aliases should be fixed . ( This covers your problem , Corry ) . . Now able to Check for confirm errors without saving to confirm report . . Path Confirmation . ? Fixed - Provide an option to delete bogus confirmation records . ? Added radio button - Cut Type Code . is vague , I think we need a button here . Now we have a forced choice button of Hour - Ahead or Real - Time which works well . . ? Fixed - Scheduled path quantity is vague , this should be Cut Volume . . ? By default it shows the original path now , New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path , then we could show Original Path , New path , and the user could copy and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in . . ? Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical . It should mimic the deal entry list . . ? Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number . It also should be able to function with NO number in it , as a typical resupply will not need an annuity . . ? Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice . It will either be a New supply or a New Sink . This should need a deal number to proceed . Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal . I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required . ? Fixed - Reason Text - this is not spelled correctly , and the text box could be much smaller . Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most . . Regards , . Will

Cara , . PreSchedule : . 1 . Concerning the path with transmission data . . . The original format was based off of Corry's suggestion . Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs . However , I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission , otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR , POD and firmness for the transmission deal . . 2 . Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points ? . 3 . We will resolve the physical / non - physical in the next release , as well as add a """" Check for Errors """" button . . 4 . Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming . We will work on it right away , but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data . We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible . . Path Confirm : . 1 . Sorting . . . Are Global ID and Tag sorting , just not in an order that you expect ? Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons . If you need the values sorted by numbers , putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you . . 2 . Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes ? . 3 . I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market . If the delivery points are different , should we require a transmission path record ? . 4 . I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems . I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications . There is currently no plan for including those features in this release . Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system . . Again , thanks for your testing efforts . We have come a long way due to your diligence . . Regards , . Will . - -

Susan - . Based upon our discussion earlier this morning and the contemplation of CL . being CP 2 CP type product , I have modified the ESA accordingly . The . modification renames the """" Counterparty """" to be a """" User """" and provides that the . """" Other Agreements """" are modified only if both the User and the counterparty to . those Other Agreements have agreed to use the Website and Modules ( e . g . , by . agreeing to the ESA and Annex documents ) . . I want to do a bit more thinking about the viability of the amendment . mechanism - an ESA with each counterparty to an Other Agreement - before we . finalize this and whether or not there is a different and / or better way to . accomplish this task . . But , in the interest of time and your schedule , I wanted you to see this for . your review and thoughts . . If you and Tom would be comfortable with the concept of """" User """" vs . . """" Counterparty """" , this would require a change to the terminology of the . Password Application and all Annex documents . . I welcome your thoughts . . Thanks . . Mark . Senior Counsel , ENA .

Phillip , . It will go along this lines : ( Conservative ) . * . We pay """" 0 """" going forward . We have already played 300K in 3Q2001 . Outstanding bill for $ 27 , 740 will hit Enron Q1 , 2002 . Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally . We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K . Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use . . This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture . Enron would receive 0 % royalty on all external sales . I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter . Also , I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved . . * * * . If we do not reach the agreement : 1 . Terminate and pay around 500 - 600k ( estimate ) The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or . 2 . Continue """" as is """" with payment differed for 90 days or merger . . We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate . . Any comments or suggestions ? . Regards , . Yevgeny . - -

Phillip , . This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event . The way the tax law works , the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent . As such , we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent . We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9 / 30 / 01 statement ( 6 , 606 shares plus cash for fractional shares ) . If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check , we can distribute gross shares . Please let me know you preference . . As you know , we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt . As such , we have a CPA , Larry Lewis , working with us to audit and set up transition files . He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments . If you would like , we can set up a conference call with you , myself , and Larry to go over the payment methodology . Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you . . Thanks , .

John , I'm sorry my question was not clear . Please advise which Sitara deal . tickets you want changed to match the spreadsheet volumes . This will be your . decision as a trader . If it doesn't matter , then we can choose a deal ticket . to adjust . Please advise by this afternoon , February 29th . . You have great ideas about consolidating the deal tickets . That is a . commercial / trader role . Not sure who makes these decisions at Enron . You may . want to check with your boss , Nelson Ferries or the Desk Director , Dick . Jenkins . What I have found about Enron , if you have a good idea . . . just go . for it . . . if it makes sense . . If your group does decide to consolidate these tickets . . . then please have . the person responsible for inputting your deal tickets to do this . consolidation . My understanding that Enron has hired someone to help you with . the billing process for your appalachian producers . . . not sure if that person . will also be inputting your deal tickets . . I'll ask Victor about the report by counterparty . CPR print manager has a lot . of different print options and sorts for the Sitara Deal tickets . . Thanks for your patience ! .

That is wonderful . However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not . been advised of the pending changes .

Attached is the latest risk policy from Peoples . It appears that they have . only made the one change that is highlighted . However , I would request that . we all re - read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other . changes which are not highlighted . Vlady - here are some thoughts on your . comments . . 1 - Stop limit size . I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change . this at this point . Peoples Board has been presented with the $ 10 million . . As we discussed , there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless . unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going . . 2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination . period of each fiscal year . . 3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50 % and 75 % levels . . The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a . different notification at the higher threshhold . It does not need to be a . formal part of enovate's policy unless we feel it absolutely necessary . . 4 - The VaR language you provided has been incorporated as Appendix IV . . Overall , there have not been many changes . I would like to get final . comments , subject of course to Peoples changing their minds on something , as . soon as possible . My goal is to execute this policy the first part of next . week . Let me know if this is practical . . Thanks , . Gregg

What happened to the Commission's deference to ongoing legislative efforts to . address direct access ? . Thinking out loud : Wood's attempt to ram through an order ending DA may be a . good thing . If he succeeds , doesn't that just prove our point about the . Commission majority's unreasoning hostility to DA ? A closure of DA now only . affects those currently offering service and I don't know of anyone doing . that . We need passage of a bill to revive DA one way or another , so that bill . would override the closure order anyway . . And if Wood fails to end DA , because Brown votes with Bilas and Duque , . doesn't that set Wood back on his heels ? . Michael Rochman . - -

Cindy - - I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi - religious . organizations : religious schools , for example , and perhaps relief . organizations like Catholic Relief Services ? I think that if we want to . consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than . the e - speak forum - - the Enron Foundation Board perhaps ? This could become . controversial , though ( recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic . attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism ) . . -

Steve , . I'm real flexible on timing , but this whole - you may not be there thing - . definitely restricts the possibilities . What are the chances of a follow - on . tour ?

Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company . The later . the better for me , but seriously , I could probably get on plane next weekend . if that was the only opportunity .

Dave : . A couple things about the limit orders : . 1 : When a customer opens up the limit order box , I think the time open . should default to 12 hours . We want the orders open as long as possible . . Now , it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour . . Traditionally , limit orders are a day order , good for the entire trading . session unless specified otherwise . . 2 . Today Pete had 13 , 000 / day on his bid because he was hit for small size . . When I tried to place a limit order , the quantity had to be in 5 , 000 . increments of 13 , 000 ( i . e . 3000 , 8000 , 18000 . . . ) . I could not overwrite the . quantity to be 15 , 000 . . 3 . Everytime a limit order is placed , an error message occurs on the system . saying error trade , price not available . . 4 . Is there a way to modify a limit order , such as changing the price , . without canceling it and resubmitting a new one ? If not , this would be a . valuable feature . . Thx , . John

We have received a letter dated 2 / 6 / 01from Chamberlain , Hrdlicka , counsel to . Fletcher Challenge , with respect to the acquisition of Fletcher Challenge by . Shell Overseas Holdings Limited , and Shell's proposed subsequent assignment . of the Fletcher Challenge Canadian nat gas trades to Apache Corporation . I . am sending copies of this letter to Russell Diamond , Mary Cook , Greg Johnston . & Joe Hunter . . Russell , I need to know if we would agree to the assignment of the trades to . Apache . . Russell , Mary : With respect to such assignment , we have an old ERMS ISDA . Local Currency Master Agreement in place . Do we want to continue to transact . w / Apache under this master , or use this as leverage to get a revised ISDA . master in place ? Among the issues I quickly spotted in the Apache master . were : . 1 . It's a Local Currency Form , so we cannot transact cross border / cross . currency products under it . 2 . We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp . of $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 3 . We've got market quotation instead of loss for terminations . 4 . No arbitration language . 5 . Hard to believe , but we've made no choice of law election ( maybe I'm . blind ) . 6 . Don't have trade option rep ( which probably doesn't matter anymore ) . 7 . ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange . Agreement - time to update . 8 . Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it . 9 . Market Disruption Events not standard . 10 . Old """" ERMS """" Collateral Annex . 11 . $ 10 , 000 , 000 Exposure Threshold - is this sufficient all this business ? . 12 . Credit Event Upon Merger triggers - 0 - threshold . 13 . LC Only Annex - really old LC language / forms everywhere . Joe Hunter , I am going to send you down the letter which has what they . believe to be all the Fletcher Challenge trades listed . Do we agree ? . As usual , they would appreciate a prompt response so they can get this . assignment completed . Thanks you all for your help !

As both of you are well aware , ENA currently owes Midland Power Cooperative ( """" MPC """" ) past due amounts for power delivered pursuant to an Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31 , 1995 by and between ENA and MPC , as amended . . I am working with Chip and Dave to determine if we can pay the past due amounts . . Two questions need to be answered ASAP : . 1 ) Is there any other entity that might be able to supply the power if ENA defaults under its agreement with MPC ? . 2 ) Is MPC considered a """" utility """" ? Dave has learned that """" utilities """" cannot refuse to serve entities in bankruptcy on a going forward basis for failure to pay pre - petition obligations ( so long as adequate assurances of future payments are provided ) .

I figure you've got all the . connections to get me into JRon field now . What night are you going to set . up poker for ? I'll be sure to clear my schedule for that night . Other than . that , I plan on going out to eat a lot and enjoying a few margaritas while I . am in town . . I may need a place to crash a few nights . I think I am staying with Becky . at the beginning of the week at least , though Lissa has moved in with her . now , so that might get a little crowded . I'll let you know when it gets . closer if I will be needing a place to crash . It would probably be good if . I could stay there on poker night at least . . Oh , by the way : I'm not black like Barry White , yo I'm white like Frank . Black is . . Alan . - -

I wanted to let you know that I sent you the TW Daily Balance report in Business Objects this afternoon . When you get a chance , will you retrieve it and try to refresh it , please ? It may take a couple of minutes to refresh , so don't worry if it seems to be taking a long time . . By having the report yourself , we can start working on automating your imbalance monitoring process , or at the very least , we may be able to come up with a way to make the estimated imbalance on the report more accurate , as Tracy and Dan requested . . Let me know how it goes . . Thanks . . Ken Powers . ( 402 ) 398 - 7065
Susan , . We had the best time . Good friends , great experiences , weather , etc . Now . we all want to move to Denver . I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so . well . . I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased . it . So - are you still planning the retreat weekend ? I am soooo . jealous . I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense . . Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced ? Do you already . have the plans made ? . Call me or write me back . Hey - I am getting more and more excited about . NYC .
There will be a few of us that will need transportation to this event . If anyone is willing to carpool please let me know . . jc . x54070
Tracy , . Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week ? I believe . that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across . non - defaulting ( Enron ) entities . Paul Simons can ( and maybe has by now ) . given opinion to this idea . Historically , I believe the opinion has long . been that such netting ( set - off against affiliates of non - defaulting party ) . in the US should work within the case of contractual default , but outside of . bankruptcy . However , in the special case of legal bankruptcy , such netting . ( though contractually agreed by the parties ) may be challenged . Introducing . the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the . likelihood . Clearly , if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser . entity , netting almost certainly will not work . . Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form . of governing confirmation and legal entity ? I believe that she is in the US , . but should be checking in . Perhaps you should try calling her ? I think we . will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum . . Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal . Volumetric / CVAR type . analysis may not yield such reliable results . . Rod . - -

Gerald , . On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions , the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery . I understand this date will be decided on a deal - by - deal basis , but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template . Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser , I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template ( for cash flow purposes ) , but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts . . I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on . Are we close to having a final version ? Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation , since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts . . Please get back to me as soon as possible ( I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now ) . Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions . . Thanks , . SBR

For ACA , yes , we have to pay the FERC based on through - put out of the system . Therefore , we do not discount it ; it would be lost revenues . . For the GRI surcharges , it is up to us ( Transwestern ) whether we discount them or not ( not the Shipper's choice ) . You are right , Lindy ; we only remit to GRI what we collect . . Therefore , we can discount the GRI surcharges all the way to zero . . Let me know if you have any questions . Jeanette . . - -

Per our conversation with Dan F . , ENA needs to understand issues related to . the distinction between """" investor owned utilities """" ( or """" IOUs """" ) and municipal . utilities ( or """" municipals """" ) in connection with derivatives activity . In the . U . S . , this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates . Thus , . we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU , except that we add an . Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance . in its state public utility commission proceedings . A copy of that . Additional Termination Event is attached for your review . Our approach with . respect to municipals is dramatically different . When negotiating an ISDA . Master with municipals , we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U . S . . Municipal Counterparty Schedule , having additional reps , the added concept of . """" Incipient Illegality """" and an enforceability opinion . A copy of that . Schedule is also attached for your reference . . We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada , . and if so , in all Canadian provinces , and whether there is a distinction when . a municipal is an investor in an IOU ( as we understand that the government . may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy ) . In that regard , would you . recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities . and / or would you recommend specific changes to our format ?
Hi John , . Just started over here at RWE Trading Americas , Inc last Friday . Not . sure whether or not you've heard of them before but they are the largest . utility in Germany with natural gas , crude and products , power and coal . trading in Europe .

They also have . approximately 130 mmcfd of Appalachian gas which , unfortunately , is . under contract with AEP as of this moment . Additionally , they've . budgeted to make a significant acquisition in the US next year . Overall , . they've got a good story to tell .

Tana - . I spoke to Joe Wright at APB this morning . Here is the rub on this matter : . - APB has a $ 500K LC outstanding to cover the US trading . - Norwegin Energy Brokers - AS is a brokerage house trading in Nordic / EU areas ( mostly in Scandinavian countries ) . - First Energy Brokers - AS was formed by NEB for purposes of trading in the Netherlands ( not sure of the timing ) . - NEB owns a large stake in FEB , but not all of the entity . . - APB is currently a 23 % owner of NEB ( thus indirectly owning a piece of FEB ) . - APB is looking to purchase the balance of the ownership of NEB which is CONFIDENTIAL ( seeking to close sometime later this month ) . - Joe indicated his thought that , post - NEB purchase , there is a good chance that NEB and FEB will be merged . - Joe also indicated that it would not be a problem for the APB LC to be expanded to these entities - if this is what credit would need . . I do not know if we have any history with either NEB or FEB , but I am sure we need to talk to credit to figure out what is needed in order for the trading to take place . Can you follow this up or do you want me to do so ? . Thanks . . Mark

Well , I am in shock about Frank . . . I just NEVER would have thought it of him . . Did Susan say how Karen is doing ? Is she working again ? It really makes me . sad when things like that happen . Why can't people just keep their . commitments , why does it hardly ever work out that people stay together . anymore . . . like our parents did . . . . How's your mom doing today ? Is she still in shock ? Please keep us posted . on how things are going for her . We will keep her in our prayers . . Write when you can , . connie . PS What does Susan and Renato think about what Frank has done ? ? ?
seems we have a few unanswered questions as to whether these first batch have jobs . My assumption is they don't but they should be told . Can you help ? . - -

Chris , . It was great to get to talk with you ! Sounds like things are going well . with the baby . I sure can't wait to see her ! ! ! . Attached is a list of the contracts I was talking about .

hi . . . . is there any way for you to put the same number of lots on the lot size product as you have on the standard MMBtu per day product ? . You have 10 lots out there now for Nov01 and 20 , 000 / day on the standard . . . can you offer 60 contracts ( 20 , 000 * 30 ) on the lots size . . the people that the product was meant for can just click their one or two lots . . its going to be the same price as the standard Nov01 contract right ? . The physical standard is a limitation for funds . . all of them trade lots . . no one wants to sit there and figure out the contracts however easy it is . . I think I can get at least 4 more funds on EOL if you can do just this . . these are people outside the Campbell types who can not trade OTC . EOL is great for funds like Ren whose traders get buy / sell orders at the beginning of the trade day ( I assume they get signals on close ) and have discretion on how to execute through the day . Versus Campbell who gets a signal and executes orders immediately regardless of liquidity . . its all to do with the way they view slipage . Liz at Renaissance was not giving you the whole picture on how much they trade . . they are an 8 Billion fund . . Last year they traded : . 156 , 000 crude contracts - most in one day . . 6 , 000 contracts . 85 , 000 nat gas - 6 , 000 highest one day . 40 , 000 Nickel - 1 , 000 highest one day . 120 , 000 Ali - 6 , 000 . 52 , 000 Cu - 5 , 000 . 24 , 000 Zn - 2 , 000 . The only other energy counterparty they have is Goldman ( this is the case with a lot of the program traders ) . . they tried MS , but said they were terrible . .

For our New York workshop , I would like to put some """" meat """" on my very . intellectual ( HaHa ) discussion of the Cover Sheet . Specifically , I would . like to go through some examples of how the Cover Sheet can be filled out , . i . e . , focus on some credit hypotheticals and provide examples of the type . of things that you can add to the Cover Sheet , i . e . , arbitration , choice of . venue , waiver of jury trial , language regarding transactions performed in . the WSPP or ERCOT control areas , etc . . If you have already drafted any provisions to add to the Cover Sheet . or have any ideas for hypotheticals , I'd appreciate your input . If you are . planning on adding standard provisions to all your EEI Cover Sheets , this . would be an excellent opportunity to allow me to """" market """" them for you and . explain their need / purpose / applicability . . Also , I don't suppose anyone has come up with a Gas Schedule to the . EEI Agreement ? ? ? Just an idea which I'm not opposed to and which would . lead us in the direction Mark and Chris seemed to be pointing , i . e . , a . Master Physical Agreement applicable to numerous types commodities . . Considering GISB is intending to revise its current form for short term . transactions and create a new form for long term transactions , this would . be an excellent opportunity to allow GISB and EEI to work with ( and not . against ) each other . . If you , or your company , is not currently on the drafting committee . for GISB's proposed revisions and creation of a new form for long term . transactions ( which , by the way , is an important point I want to make to . the GISB group that we do not want two separate forms , one for short and . one for long in the first place ) , I encourage you to contact GISB @ . GISB1 @ aol . com and get involved . . Please let me know your thoughts . . Thanks . . Dede Russo
Any more on this issue . Rick
Phil , Can you send Tyrell the schedule that is to be attached as Appendix A ?
I believe what Lisa ( Sawyer ? ) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31 , 2001 . I don't think there would be any system changes required . Typically , TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and ( if this is correct ) the surcharge should have an end date of 10 / 31 / 2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do . If it's not entered that way , an end date could be entered now ( whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts ) and that should take care of it . . Elizabeth , Is this correct ? I know you're on a project , please let me know if you can check this or who can . . Thank you ! . Lindy . - -

Rick , . One thought to absorb some of the budget would be to purchase Blackberry mobile devices for some of the RAC staff . With many of the business units migrating to the new building , it is likely to be beneficial to have continuous e - mail access when Underwriters and others in the group are away from the floor . The cost of the units , which seem to be the technology of choice , is about $ 300 apiece ; monthly charges are about $ 30 . . Please let me know your opinion . . Regards , . Dave

I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party . They are currently selling the gas to ENA .

Hi Jeff , . We met , at least telephonically , while I was still in EES' San Ramon office . on some substation projects we were working on last year . I've since moved . on to Houston ( all roads lead there , so they say ) , and am now in Structuring . and working on some of the new , heavy industrial deals that EES has inherited . from ENA . I've got a customer who is a petroleum refiner in Downey , CA - . right in the middle of LA - who is interested in potentially building a cogen . plant , perhaps as big as 49 MW . Air emissions issues completely aside ( the . nightmare can wait ) , can you tell me what the current status of new QF . development is with SCE ? I've checked with all the commodity guys I know . here on the floor , and they're not up to date . Greg Cordell thought that , as . part of AB1890 , the UDCs got a moratorium on new QFs in their territory - as . in , they don't have to accept any more projects . . Can you shed any light on the topic ? If you're not the guy , do you know who I . should talk to ? . Thanks a bunch ! . Tom Adams . 713 - 853 - 9552

Attached is a list of the Termination Letters I have been able to locate so far . Tanya suggested that Bear Stearns termination is just a close - out of a NYMEX margin position and I have a call into Greg Whiting to see if that is the case . . I spoke to Craig Breslau about the Pemex termination and he knows nothing about that . He said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk . What are your thoughts on that ? . There appear to be two International Paper Deals . Craig Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $ 12 , 163 , 283 . There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $ 1 , 311 , 164 . Craig , any knowledge of this other one ? . No copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for ( i ) deal no . Y 49018 . 1 for $ 81 , 083 , and ( ii ) deal no . 49011 . 1 for $ 442 , 000 . . That just leaves the Socal - JP Morgan on Debbie's list with no copy .

Rick / Bill / David , . Generally , we have managed to keep our main counterparts transacting , but things are tight . We are signing netting agreements and agreeing to collateral threshholds , but we are negotiating hard where we think that we will be so close to collateral lines in the next few months that we would actually have to post . . As we go into this week , we need to hold on to those we have , incrementally open up a few more , and start to get people to business as usual . Amongst the things that continues to be missing are the OFFICIAL STORY ( we have access to the newspaper here , too ) , good communication regarding global relationships , . and calendar and status of new developments regarding credit facilities , equity issuance / raising . . . . . Not that some of it is getting through , it just comes through random channels and we know very little more than our counterparts that have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal . To that end , it has been suggested here that Houston ( PR ? ) with RAC / Finance develop a daily script of talking points for the masses . We have traders and credit people talking all day to counterparts - they really could use a strong story to tell without have to think about it . I am very confident that I can tell a reasonable story myself , but I am concerned that I do not have all the facts at my disposal and my guess is that the average trader / credit specialist is probably at a greater disadvantage . . Thoughts ? . Ted

It might be good if you two participate in this discussion with Hickerson in the morning . Also , David , you might want to discuss w / Whalley beforehand . What exactly are we going to restrict Gary and his traders from trading ? Sheila Glover says we may have trader retention issues if the traders are prohibited from trading for their own account the securities that they are most familiar with . . . . But I think this is clearly contrary to how Ted , Legal , etc . think our policy should work . So what are we willing to do to compromise , if anything ? The policy says the Risk Committee can give dispensation . To do this , do we want to require some type of review of Hickerson's personal accounts ? And who would do that ? . Cassandra . . - -

Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system . or did you already do that ? . Chris
Andy , . I am handling three insurance claims that need extensions of time for suit against Underwriters . I would like to send the attached request for extension of time tomorrow or Monday , given that we will start running into vacation schedules otherwise . There are agreed extensions of time in place for the first two matters already , and they expire December 31 . Sharron West , the Underwriters' adjuster on all three claims ( I believe that the policy is the same in each case ) , has asked that we submit all requests for extensions of time at once . . The only somewhat problematic matter is Enron Petrochemicals , in which we have submitted a fully documented claim some time ago . Subject to what Jim Studdert thinks , I thought Underwriters would have paid us by now . By getting an extension of time , we may be giving Underwriters the message that they have more time to delay . We had to file a third - party action against Baytank in order to prevent Underwriters' subrogation rights from being prejudiced . I do not want to incur costs prosecuting a third - party case that I don't have much faith in . Remember than an extension of time does not preclude us from filing suit earlier . If we don't get paid by year end or shortly thereafter , we can always choose to file suit then . . I invite everyone's comments . . Britt . - -

Some of the complicated booking issues are : . 1 . We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA . 2 . We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA . 3 . We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal . 1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals . Number 3 is more difficult . The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included . . Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked ? Let me know if you have questions . I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others . I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100 % workable . . Thanks ! . Chris

As we discussed in our special call last week , I asked Brian Cragg from . Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what , if anything , the CPUC can do . in lieu of suspending direct access . . ABX 1 says the CPUC """" shall suspend """" DA , but does not give any time line for . doing so , nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend . it . This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA , especially . while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento . The President could have . her own investigation or propose her own solutions - - all the while delaying . the suspension . Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in . place - - although he said it was a """" stretch . """" Brian said she could , for . example , argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of . implementing ABX 1 . He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however , . stretching the concept a bit too far . Nonethless , limiting DA to a net short . position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law . . She could also institute an """" open season """" through some defined date , such as . Jan 1 , 2002 , and suspend DA thereafter . . She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation . - - which , of course , could either kill DA altogether or implement some . combination of exit fee / DAopen season / DA limitation . . Let's discuss strategy on our next call . . Sue Mara . Enron Corp . . Tel : ( 415 ) 782 - 7802 . Fax : ( 415 ) 782 - 7854
Talked to Mark Hodge from the PX this morning regarding the charges on our . statement . He said that the daily block forwards transaction fee has been . waived for July and Aug . ( . 02 transaction charge ) . However , the tariff was . changed on May 2nd that increased the settlement ( aka clearing ) charges to . . 03 per mwh per day . . I asked him why the daily block forwards are so expensive when we get the . 01 . charge as a preferred customer on the term block forwards . He said it's . because of the costly bookout process . I told him we do financial onlys , but . not bookouts , and restated that . 03 is more expensive than brokers . He said . that because the tariff filing of . 03 was the maximum , these fees can be . negotiated away from the . 03 max . , especially since we don't add to the costs . of bookouts . So , whoever among us is the queen or king of daily block . forwards , or our block forward accounts in general , I suggest we do negotiate . a lower rate on the daily schedules . . Both Brett and I tried to access the tariff on the PX website , but we . couldn't read it . So , if someone has better clearance or web tools than us , . please let us know so we can update ours .

Hi , all : . We are planning another series of Open Houses for prospective students in . December and early next year , and we are hoping to broaden the geographic . area in which we host these events . We are currently thinking of having . Open Houses in the Sacramento area , the North Bay , and the Peninsula . Does . anyone have suggestions for appropriate venues ? The requirements are . pretty simple - the space would need to seat about 200 people and have very . basic equipment ( i . e . a microphone ) . In the past , we have held Open Houses . at hotels , since they are easily located and able to provide light . refreshments . Any ideas ? Thanks ! . Julie

John , . I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group . . As you know , Dale Surbey , who was managing the London unit of the Research . Group , . is moving to EBS . Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of . talent we have currently . in London . . Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston , it's time . to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position . . My recommendation is Steve Leppard . Steve emerged not only as the most . technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader , . highly . respected by his peers and internal customers . Steve has a very high energy . level . and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent . . His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron . I value . technical . skills of Anjam , but in spite of my loyalty to him , don't think he is the . same caliber . as Steve . However , I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to . Houston . for 2 years . I think that the opportunity to work in Houston , would be a . sufficient . incentive to keep him in Enron . By the way , his performance feedback has . greatly improved . . Please , let me know what you think . . Vince

He works well with Mike and he is willing to do whatever we need him to do . He is spending the rest of the week to suck as much out of Daren as he can . If there is any training for the logistics systems that he can go to , he should do that as well . If you have any other recomendations to get him up to speed on the Logistics side I sure would appreciate it . . Tom

Staff is considering very broad categories ( buckets ) which might contain the issues in this proceeding that we might agree to give Judge Birchman . Our list is attached . . Also , Judge Birchman will probably ask us about cross examination times . If possible , it would be wise to be prepared with a time estimate , either as a single entity or as a member of a group . If that's not possible , if you could prepare a list of witnesses you are not interested in crossing , that might give him some indication that the December phase of the hearing could fit within the allotted time . . - issues 11 - 8 . wpd

George , Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some . help . Why are we collecting so much groundwater .

After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE . business review , there are two areas that I think I need to understand . better .

Larry , . I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger , Crane , and Sonora . accounts . Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that . EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts . Darron indicated that . these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit . Therefore , . fees would be required . A fee would not be required if there was no . intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year ( September 1 , 2001 . through August 31 , 2002 ) . . 1 . If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000 , then EOTT would . owe the minimum fee - $ 26 . . 2 . If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov . 1 , then the fee . is required if the source operates in the fiscal year . . Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service . Therefore , a . 2002 fiscal year fee would not be required . This needs to be communicated . to Mr . Blackburn in writing . Our database shows Crane to have all . grandfathered tanks . Therefore , the only trigger for a fee would be an . active Title V permit . Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and . if so when ? . Jon E . Fields , REM .

Still here , but don't know for how long . . . . I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground . Because our credit rating keeps dropping , our trading abilities are being adversely affected . I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate . We may not make it to the end of the year , Dynegy deal or not . I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt , but if they don't , it doesn't look good . . . . . Oh , well . We'll all just move on and look for other jobs . . Oh , by the way , we just moved into the new building this past weekend . We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes . .

Hi , Jeff - - . I just had to write to someone who understands how CRAZY the electricity . argument is getting . Make sure to check out the Union - Tribune's Web site . today to peruse the articles on dereg ( www . uniontrib . com ) . Jan . Smutney - Jones did a good job responding to Rosenfeld's voter initiative . plan , but the headline and the front page only lead people to believe that . there's no alternative but going back to regulation - - and a state - owned . power authority at that ( imagine ! ) . It would have been very good to have . ARM get a mention as well - - but maybe it isn't ready to be public yet . . When the group does put a stake in the ground , it will have to be sure to . craft its messages in a way that avoids the appearance of reacting to . Rosenfeld rather than being the pro - active and pro - consumer ESP's . . I don't know if it's in your best interest , and I'd like to hear your . thoughts on this , but since the reporters are either being very biased or . not hearing enough from the pro - competition side , would an op - ed from Enron . help calm things down and give people a chance to hear about what positive . benefits a competitive market - - if allowed to exist - - can bring ? I . thought the WSJ article on Monday was great , but few San Diegans read the . Journal and rely on the UT for their news . However , the editorial pages . are well read and may serve you well . I can help out your team on drafting . this if you're interested . Or if there's any other information gathering . you need , just let me know . . Anyway - - hope you had a good Thanksgiving and that you'll be able to come . down here soon . . Have a good Wednesday , . Dana . Dana Perino . dana @ gablegroup . com . 619 - 234 - 1300 ext . 238
Here are a couple of comments after my discussions with AA regarding the . Lehman Forward . . I would like a proviso in the introduction of the forward that explicitly . states that """" it is the intent of the parties that this contract does not give . Party A any of the rights that rank senior to a common shareholder of ENE . Corp . """" I believe this is the economic deal that Lehman is agreeing to and . would like the explicit statement to provide comfort on the accounting side . . Given that this contract is governed by a Master ISDA , are there any . circumstances that the Master ISDA would provide for cash settlement for . something that is outside the control of Enron ? AA and I are not sure of the . answer to this question and are soemwhat confused on the point of netting and . setoff procuedures under the Master ISDA .

I just spoke with Krystal at Kern and John Stafford at Patina : . Kern Legal will not finish reviewing until Monday . At that time they will approve , revise , or reject the changes to the Assignment Agreement . I reiterated that Enron is comfortable with the changes . . John Stafford is comfortable with Gerald's Indemnity Letter Agreement ( below ) , but would strongly prefer to have the indemnity language incorporated into the Assignment Agreement itself , if it is possible in a timely fashion . . John indicated he would be willing to conference in with Gerald and Kern's attorney ( s ) first thing Monday morning if we felt it would be helpful . . Bottom line : It looks like we can shut the door on this , one way or the other , on Monday morning . . Tyrell Harrison . 303 575 6478 .

Please read note below from our SAP Timekeeping Team : . By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping . and eHR Online . Well it is almost upon us . Some of the business units in . GPG will implement self - service time entry but ET & S along with other business . units will not implement self - service it at this time . Your timekeeper will . still be responsible for entering your payroll information i . e . vacation , . sick . Because of the upcoming July 3 - 4 holiday and more importantly the new . SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper . as soon after June 23 as possible . This will be the first time entry period . via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly . The new . system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time . to complete payrolls . If you have changes to your timesheet after you have . submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary . adjustments will be made the following pay period .

We also changed from a two - month term . to a three - month term because in the event that neither of us terminates the . contracts by Feb . 15 , we could then extend this agreement if we desired and . not end up trying to sell the awkward block of March / April .

We have a potential deal with Allegheny for them to post a coal product on EnronOnline . The total value is thin but the desk is supportive and Dan Diamond has been charging ahead . In light of Enron's position currently , do we gain or lose media points by announcing in the near future that EOL is allowing third parties to post on their site ? If you are against this , we need to crawfish our way out of the deal with Allegheny and put an all - stop on the 1 or 2 others we've been pursuing . If you think it can be spun in a good way for Enron , give me your thoughts and we'll close the deal . . I know you're underwater right now , but I don't want to close this deal on the assumption that you're OK and find out later you weren't . . Brad

In addition , George and the coal group completed . theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re - defined . goals as part of the process . . Also , I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was . leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a . successful year . Most of this information has never been put together . before . I have projected out a 50 % growth factor as a starting point and . will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet . these goals . As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the . EGM presentation and gathered information for the analyst meeting . . Let me know if you need something else or if this is not what you are looking . for . . Mike

Stacey , . Settlements has brought an invoice to zero out a sale of 10 , 000 mmbtu to El . Paso Merchant Energy for 4 / 20 / 00 on PGEV . There are 2 packages of 5000 deal . numbers 247426 and 247583 on the market side and deal 247676 on the supply . side . These are HPLC brokered deal on PGEV that are buying and selling the . same 10 , 000 to El Paso Merchant Energy . The purchase and sale price is the . same $ 3 . 02 .

barkerde @ nmenergy . com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List : . Having worked the same shift schedule that the ISO uses , I have something new to . ponder .

Jeanne - - . I guess the other big question is this - what is the best argument one could make that any retroactive calculation ( and application in a forward - going manner ) is illegal ? We need to develop this argument ASAP . . Jim . - -
Has your initial question been answered ? . Jim . - -
Brad , . Here are my thoughts on your concerns . . * You needs curve inputs . This is an IT job . I can help you for the curves . before the system is properly set up . . * Intrinsic value vs Time value : . The intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . If you have a . rough idea about the allocation as . you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the . model . The difference between the . total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . However , by . pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options . . In the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is . hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value . . * Factor of loading : Factor of loadings are used to give historical . correlation matrix . The three factors correspond to . paralle shift , slopping and curveture . The covariance matrix in the model . is expressed in the form . COVAR = row ( vol_ { i } ) * ( Correl ( i , j ) ) * Colum ( vol_ { j } ) where vols are . the implied volatilities from the vol curve . . ( Correl ( i , j ) ) = L * L' + residue ( small ) . where L is the factor of loading matrix . So in a simple words , the factor of . loadings ( say , 60x3 ) are a simplier way for us to . remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60x60 ) . . Let me know if I can offer further help . . Zimin . Brad Horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 AM

Hi Louise . . I received this spreadsheet from Gemma Butler in London which shows all Director - level and above employees for EEL . . No filters are currently active , and all Female employees are at the top . . Unfortunately , myself and Jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices . . Would you be able to identify possible candidates for us ? . Here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation . . . . Females : . 8 Commercial , 1 EEL . 6 CS / ST , no EEL . Males : . 10 Commercial , 4 EEL . 6 CS / ST , no EEL ( primarily have ST ) . . I think we need a few additional Commercial Females , and a few Male & Female CS candidates to give us a balanced portfolio . . Although I think the London office will be closed by the time I get the names to them today , we should have their data by early next week . . Also , I have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees Marcello Romano identified , as well as a few others . . There does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting , but i'll let you make the call . . Thanks , . Sunjay

The question has arisen as to whether Enron has """" personal days """" , that , . you can take in case of repair problems at home ; car problems ; sick spouse , . sick child , etc . . I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is """" no """" , but they . can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor . I talked this over . with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed . two ( 2 ) personal days per year to take care of personal business and . not have to take a vacation day , discretionary day , or leave of absence . . If you have advance notice ( such as an air conditioner repair scheduled ) , . please let me know when you are going to take these days . If an . emergency arises with no notice , please call in and let me know that you . are taking a personal day . It will be coded on your time sheet . . These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of , """" funeral . leave """" , """" family leave """" , or """" civic duty leave """" . They are just a way of being . able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise . . These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by . all of us . . If you have any questions , please call me . . Shirley . 3 - 5290
Hi , everybody , . following up on our discussions on stressing correlations I made a . spreadsheet and a DLL . . Here is what it does : . in the input ( """" Main """" sheet ) the user has to specify : . - the size of the correlation matrix ; . - the row and column for the element he wants to stress ( row = 1 and col = 3 in . the example ) . - the integer number N_iter ; . - the original correlation matrix . . In the output ( see sheet """" Results """" ) we see 2 columns : . - the first column contains possible correlation values ( from - 1 to 1 , . N_iter + 1 numbers ) for the element ( 1 , 3 ) , . - the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the """" stressed """" . correlation matrix . ( which is the same as the original matrix except the elements ( 1 , 3 ) and ( 3 , 1 ) . which take values from - 1 to 1 ) . . Thus , the user can see which values for the chosen element ( 1 , 3 ) are . permitted . ( those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive ( marked green in the . example ) . . The user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is """" not . permitted """" to this particular element . ( the smallest eigenvalue is negative ) . Then the user might have a few options : . 1 . all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the . chosen element has the . desired correlation in it , but the change in the correlation matrix is the . """" smallest """" possible . ( in the sense of matrix norm ) ( this is my next step to do for this . spreadsheet ) . . 2 . Just one column ( and the corresponding row , of course ) will change , while . the rest of the matrix . will stay unchanged ( Kevin's suggestion ) . In this case the user have to . choose which column ( and row ) . he prefers to modify ( in my example - column - row 1 or column - row 3 ) . . We can discuss this approach with Risk Control and see how they like it . I . send you only the spreadsheet with an example now . . Tanya .

Louise , we have been pre - paying the positions to some of our customers . Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract , and then re - purchasing the swaps . In some cases they are asking to get pre - paid , so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron's Cost of Funds ) . . However , I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases , so that we offer a better alternative to the customer , than their own cost of funds . It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that . . Questions : Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate ? If so , with whom should I speak to get it granted to EdeM ? . Best regards .
Michelle : This is a request to extend our transportation agreement for one more day through December 18 at the agreed upon $ . 08 / MMBtu demand fee . . Could you let me know whether we can keep the same contract number or not . . Thanks , Terri Dickerson

I got this form agreement from Jeff . It was prepared recently for PEMEX . I understand it was approved for general use by Susan . All I've done so far is change the names of the Parties and change the description of the purpose and asked Steve for comments on these questions : . 1 . TW or ETS ? Steve would like this to be as broad as possible , but ETS probably isn't a legal entity that can enter into contracts . When we looked at TransColorado , we used Enron Pipeline Company . Stan is an officer and can execute documents for EPC . Steve wanted the Party defined to be broad so that it could encompass several possible entities on Enron's part . . 2 . Is the """" purpose """" appropriate per the discussions Steve had with Questar ? Steve said that the agreement should express the intent to evaluate for a partnership interest , possibly operating the Southern Trail facilities and / or purchasing a portion of Southern Trails . Again , in any event , to be broad in this description . . I was going to discuss these points with Legal and get a final blessing and send over to Gary Schmitt ( his e : mail is garysc @ questar . com )

Louise , . I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto / MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine . In addition , I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow . . Are there any types of transactions that would be """" inappropriate """" to close ? For example , if we do an outsourcing deal for three years , how do we know that Dynegy will honor the contract ? . Regards , Jean

Stinson / Vince , . The Henwood runs for Dabhol are , at least temporarily , over . However , the . main modeller for Henwood ( David Yumigada ) works out of their California . office . . It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs , and . explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group . . In aparticular , now that I am going through some of the comments people have . raised on the PSIM model , I think there is value in understanding the way . Henwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts , ramp up costs , and with issues of . cycling plants . . I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the . PSIM , and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models . . This is a suggestion , and so please let me know if you see value in this . . Regards , . Sandeep .

Rob Cooper ( of US Gypsum ) asked me to send him an email concerning our decision to not to force USG to provide the remaining 8 months of LOC and also asked me to verify a couple of other points . Below is my reply . Please let me know if you have any comments . Paul , please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below . . __ - - . Rob , . After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims , we will not proceed in seeking the additional $ ___ letter of credit ( worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges ) . The current letter of credit valued at $ __ is sufficient . . Also , our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1 , 2002 . In our latest discussions with SOCAL , they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time .

Per our conversation today you wanted to know what I propose , there are only a few things . I would like us to follow the law as closely as possible : . 1 ) I want per Texas law you to pay what your requested in child support , so in the future there will be no discrepency . Paid through the Clerk of Court in Harris County . . 2 ) I would like to follow the visitation guidelines that Miram provided to me . I am willing to work with you to make it more convenient ( with Payton's best interest in mind ) . . 3 ) I still propose that you pay my attorney fees . During your Orlando visit on July 28th with Payton you stated , . """" You wanted to do whatever you needed to do to make me happy because then you knew Payton would be happy . """" This would make me happy and it would help me to provide for Payton the best I can . . 4 ) I am willing to cooperate with your family in scheduling visits within reason with Payton . . 5 ) In Orlando on July 29th you asked if I could bring Payton to New Orleans for your Uncles wedding . . I told you would think about it . After careful consideration I feel that at Payton's age that will not be a wise decision . . These are the issues that I can think of right now . Once you provide me with a proposal I will let you know if anything else comes to mind . I feel by both parties following the Texas law it will work in everyones best interest .

Louise - - . I need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from Enron to UBS . If any of the data is viewed by FERC as being jurisdictional assets , than Enron would need to inform FERC of that transfer before the transfer . Clearly , customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information . I need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data . . Who can help me get a better handle on this on Monday ? . Also , I understand the """" adoption """" by UBS of Enron contracts . Initially I was under the impression that this was simply a """" review """" . Again , any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by Enron . I have seen one draft of the Interim Agreement , but assume that you would do this for EEI and other physical contracts . Am I right ? . Thanks , . Jim . -

Per our various discussions , I am sending an email to reiterate the . disposition of volumes at Meter 9862 , the Lehman Spinaker pay meter . At this . time , the General Land Office is transporting their share of production . ( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and HPL is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % . . The GLO has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective September . 1 , 2000 . During this time , some test gas flowed . I have had the HPL . purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had . both deals moved to 9862 . The meter should probably be designated a . Callout / Swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after . the production month by Volume Management . . For October production forward , I am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter . to ensure that the GLO receives a volume which should be close to their . percentage after actuals close for the month . This should alleviate any . large balance swings on their agreement . . Anita : For September , I need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket . 379424 ; HPL gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . Please unallocate the transport . and purchase at 9848 . The meter is a daily swing right now . Let me know . when you are ready and I will change the allocation methodology . . I apologize for the length of this email , I want to make sure that we are all . on the same page , to the extent that we need to be , prior to this deal . getting too far down the road . Please do not hesitate to call me if you have . any questions , comments , concerns , etc . I am at extension 35251 . . Thank you all for your time and patience , . Mary

There is no counterparty set up in the system as Coral Canada US , Inc . The deals that Ann sent to me were not changed because the counterparty name was not set up and address information was not sent to me with the corrected confirmations . These were sent back to Ann . As far as I know the Trader did not give me any information on the counterparty name and address information . .

Dear All . Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of the peer group mapping by function . It was decided that each member would review the proposal to move from 4 peer groups to 3 for Mid Year . . The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve Kean . . Under your review of the attached information , please focus on the final two pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the proposed peer group . structure . . I have copied in the HR leads for your business area . They have been instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any specific information you require concerning placements with your business area . . I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in function placements within the peer groups for some business units ; it will be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues . . Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next meeting under separate cover . For our London colleagues we will aim for a morning meeting . . David Oxley
I would very much like to meet Vince , unfortunately I am in back to back . meetings all day today . Maybe we could rearrange next time Vince is in London . or I am in Houston . . Regards . PAUL

I know we sent in an expression of interest a few weeks ago . I assume that is on the portion of the pipe upstream of the California border ? ? Do we know what their conversion costs are ? I had heard that the conversion costs were very high and actually made the capacity costs out of the market . Is that true ? Is Questar truly going forward with the conversion and will they have it ready for service by June 1st next year ? ? Why would Questar spend the money if they aren't sure there will be any take away capacity at the border ? . Hope all is well Kim ! . Mike McGowan . - -

Hi , . The number is 281 - 370 - 7838 . . I did not think of it , but without the pipe one has to balance ones own , doesn't one . Of course the major problem was the people with HPL , not the counter - parties . Who's doing that for you guys ? . Jen came home for the Memorial Day weekend so we just bummed around . Saw Pearl Harbor , watched a few DVD's , and ate way to much . . When you get time let us know about your """" bad luck """" . I hope Jake wasn't helping you too much . . I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system . We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of Yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of Klipsch speakers . Awesome is the only word to apply . I'm sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door . ( It's a young couple with a baby ) ( Not near as nice as the other young couple I know ) . . Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good . : ) . Stock market still sucks , but as long as it pays for groceries and taxes we'll be OK . . I'm off to get Linda's gas guzzlin , environment ruining , SUV washed and buffed . Then I must re - stock my CD - R's and load up on some more music . You can see how well I'm utilizing my time in doing productive things . . Later , . Ken . P . S . I thought WAHA was where all the pillaging of California was taking place .

Michelle , when we were checking out 280G issues , we came across this . I am worried because it appears they slipped in a UK citizen . . . . . we did not run the traps on the U . K . I fear the worst ! ! ! ! Since I have not given Wachovia the names yet we could remedy but need to move fast . . . . . . I hesitate to call anyone until we can touch base given the sensitivity . Also , how will we pay from the Trust and not let Europe know . . . . they'll be wanting to pay him too ! ! ! ! Please advise . . Hope you are enjoying the cruise . . - -

Hey Russell , . We talked about this point earlier ( see an e - mail to you dated September 22 , . 2000 ) and we agreed that the guarantees would not reference both Enron North . America and Enron Canada Corp . There were a number of reasons for this ( ie . . complexity regarding future amendments , the differences / peculiarities between . Canadian and American law , possible """" permanent establishment """" issues we had . discussed , etc . ) . You may also want to look at the e - mail I sent to you on . September 26 , 2000 ( re : the East desk deals with ENA ) . . Is this not the case anymore ? I think it is better to have separate . guarantees for all of the reasons mentioned in the September 22 , 2000 e - mail , . the September 26 , 2000 e - mail and this e - mail . . Please let me know . . Mark Powell
Don , . Hey , how's it going ? Gone fishing lately ? I talked to Kayne earlier today about a posting this guy is interested . Kayne tells me you are the man with the opening . I just wanted to forward this to you so you could take a look at . Jay schedules gas for EES and is interested in your position . I explained to him generally what the position is about , but things have changed . He says he talked to Larry Campbell also . In fact , Larry might have talked to you about him already . I haven't worked with him before , so I can't specifically vouch for his work ability ( Larry can fill you in better in that area ) , but he does have good communications skills and is easy to get along with . . . ( team player ) . Also , he is an internal employee . Attached below is his resume . . John . -

Hi Shirley , . This email is in reference to your vmail regarding my rescheduling my . meeting on tomorrow at 2 pm with Vince . That is fine with me because the .

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals . One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely , given the legislative session end of September 15th ( ? ? ) , that we are going to get much traction . ( Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call ) . It may not be relevant in this environment , but this idea makes sense . It is an issue of who will listen and who will act . It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR . Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis , anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed . . The proposal to DWR could go as follows : Either Edison and PG & E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction . Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process . A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts . . In addition , it appears for our analysis , the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing . As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE . ( I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs . Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out ? ) . Let me know your thoughts . . Michael Etringer . West Power Origination . Phone : 503 - 464 - 3836 .

Kevin . I'm contacting you in the hope that you may be able to provide us with some info regarding British Energy . I'm a trader on the UK Power Desk where BE are one of our major counterparties . We are currently assessing what their strategy is likely to be in the UK and this depends in part on how profitable their US / Canadian assets are . Do you have any insights on what they are up to in these markets right now - i . e how much of their output do you believe they have hedged forward and at what price ? If BE succeed in restarting another 1600MW at Bruce is this likely to depress the market price there ? In general what do we believe the outlook to be for the US and Canadian markets . . Any info would be much appreciated ! . Should you need to speak to me my phone number is + 0044 207 783 6919 . Many thanks . Derek

Ramona , . Gosh , something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems . Lindy will be back tomorrow and I will discuss this with her . We are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools . If we decide to make a change I suspect that it may require a system change , but it is too early to make a decision just yet . I also think that we should think about how to link EOL transactions through the entire contracting process . I know that NNG is probably a little further on this than we are , but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year . . I will continue to ponder this and discuss this with Lindy upon her return tomorrow . . Thanks , Kim . . - -

Peter : . Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I . was not aware of your previous discussions . In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA . Collateral Opinion , they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify . the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor / creditor relationship between the . parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge . . Do you have any thoughts on this ? Is this an alternative that we should . consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume . counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post . cash collateral to us ? .

Jeff we talked about developing messages around PGE's pricing , etc . I'll check with the PGE folks to get a good set of facts to address this issue . Messaging is tough , but I'd suggest we focus on : ( 1 ) the total dollars at issue - - $ 318 , 071 isn't a big deal ; ( 2 ) PGE is 61 out of 74 in terns of total sales ; and ( 3 ) PGE's took a position in the market and is selling power purchased at high prices ( PGE is a net short position ) . . The additional facts we need are how the dollars flow to Enron Corp . given PGE's power cost adjustment stipulation . . - -

Richard : Robert Knight said that you might be able to provide me some guidance regarding the legal issues involved in the recording of conversations . A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation , and want the ability to playback from their desktop . I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved , and I needed to get clarification . They were under the impression , that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording , they didn't think it applied . Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy , or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal , who might that person be ? Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated . Thanks for your time . . Regards , . Kathy . Kathy W . Link . Manager , Telephony Services . Enron NetWorks , LLC . 713 - 345 - 5418

We've had a request from AA to provide them with some sort of write - up or documentation from our research group on the valuation methodology used on the contingent issuance instrument for 18 million shares that was a part of the Raptor transaction completed at the end of March . Apparently , this request has come from AA's expert in this area ( I believe that his name is Dechundra , or something like that . I've probably destroyed the spelling on that . You guys are probably very familiar with him . ) Anyway , is there such documentation that we can provide them easily ? If so , let me know so that we can try to get AA finished with their review of the transaction .

John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right . According to . john , the group significantly reduced postions ( on the whole ) . What about . the forward forward vol ?

After further discussion , he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project , and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct . We provided a brief overview of the status of the project , and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off .

The ERCOT team has met with Joe Des Champs for the Mid Marketing position in . our region . It is my understanding that you must interview Joe before we can . make him a job offer . I would like to proceed with the interview process . . Joe worked for me at Williams as the lead trader in the West . Here are my . thoughts on Joe and why he is a good fit for our group . . 1 . He has a very good understanding of the trading business , especially . natural gas in Texas and the western US . . 2 . His personality is a great fit for Texas ( especially with the loss of Jim . Ducote ) . Joe has a lot of successful relationships within Texas and relates . well to Texans . His initial appearance and manners appear to be easy going . and laid back , however he is a very agressive and effective trader . His . command of the physical gas business is outstanding . . 3 . Learns fast and relates well to traders . I believe Doug and Joe will . work well together . . 4 . Likes to work the phones . . What he is not : . 1 . He is new to the power business . However , he served the Williams / AES . plants in California . So he is familiar with the power . . I would be glad to discuss Joe in detail or set up the phone interview . I . have attached Joe's resume . Thanks .

We have not yet showed either of these to Sato , but would plan to do so early next week . We met with Freshfields for 2 hours the other day to get some basic thoughts and to gauge their interest in helping to draft the JV agreement . They thought our MOU could be more simple and while I don't completely disagree , I'd like to make sure Sato is 90 - 95 % there before we bring their senior guy ( s ) to Houston . Regardless , we need to run both of you through where we are today and plans for the next couple of weeks . I have a meeting and dinner with Nakatani ( head of corp planning and guy who would sign MOU tomorrow ) . From all indications it looks as though things are still on track . There still are a number of items still to work out , but some of these might be deliberately left blank in the MOU . .

I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis . Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque . DOE indicated that their current . PNM rate is """" 5 . 3 cents , exclusive of the demand charge . """" Tino's consultant . claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of . approximately 7 cents / KWh . Assuming we need to come in at 10 % less than the . current rate , our bogey is 6 . 3 cents / KWh . This is at the high end of the . range we hoped they'd be in . . Additionally , DOE indicated that they need """" redundancy """" and don't want to . rely on PNM for back up power . They want a multiple turbine facility - - i . e . , . more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines . The new pipeline will . need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse . supplies and guard against supply failure . They have not asked for fuel oil . backup . . I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away , but the . power price number looks very promising to me . I think its worth scrubbing . down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O & M . assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine . configuration we'd be using . . If this price is really as favorable as I think , can we make another run at . the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest ? . DF

ESPs at the request of such customers """" . Since the letter was dated this . Monday , Dec . 3 , that means Enron - as of Monday - was going to start . de - DASRs or switches to new ESPs by next Monday , Dec . 10 , or even . earlier . . Is Enron still on this accelerated time schedule for switching to new . ESPs or de - DASRs ? I read this to mean Enron will literally exist the . direct access market for all its customers no later than Monday , Dec . . 3 . Was something else intended ? Has this schedule slowed down at all ? . I think that if the CPUC believes Enron is really leaving by Monday , it . is just going to do nothing . What should I tell the CPUC re Enron's . schedule ? . Thanks , . Dian

Patrice : . I understand from Jerry at Crestar that you two have spoken and that we will be revising deals 599461 and 1022740 for Sept 2001 to keep the firm deal , 599461 , whole . Have you communicated this to Kirk Lenart in logistics so he can repath the deals ? I will be out of the office this afternoon , but will be back on Monday . If a payment needs to be made , we can get it out on Tuesday . We've only short paid $ 500 . 00 . . Going forward , should we be keeping the firm deal whole and swinging on the AOS deal ? We've had some confusion in the past on how to handle these deals and I would like to be able to verify that we are accounting for them correctly . I tried to find a copy of the contract , but have not come across one as of yet . . Thanks , . Megan . x54780

Jeff - . I was going through my emails when I came across one from you to . which I never responded . A few days after you asked if I was working . with anthrax , I was whisked to DCv on a charter flight to assist with . the investigation there . . It was an amazing and intense experience during which I learned a . tremendous amount . It was very different being a part of a team , as . opposed to directing an investigation . I unfortunately did not have . much time to explore DC , although we were staying in a very nice part . of Dupont Circle . I am happy to be back in Atlanta ( where I have been . for only 3 weeks since July ) . I still have quite a bit of work to . complete related to the investigation before letting the rest of the . team make their advice , suggestions , and contributions . . How have you been ? I read briefly that Enron was having some tough . times . Did this affect you directly , or were the happenings in . another division ? . Are you going back to Louisville for Thanksgiving or will you be . traveling ? I will be here in Atlanta , working , and hopefully taking a . couple of hours off to enjoy a little turkey nwith friends . . The PennAtlanta alumni club will be holding an holiday party in 2 . weeks which I hope to attend if I am in town . I know 2 other other . Penn - Atlanta couples , so perhaps it will be a good way to reconnect . with some people . Does Houston have any similar events ? . I hope that things are going well for you . I will be an aunt by the . time that I will next speak to you ! ! ! ! . Best , . andi

Dear Jeff : . Thanks very much for agreeing to write for the journal . As I mentioned during our phone conversation , we intend to profile some of the Wharton Alumni and their recommendations for success in one's career . I heard you talk during the pre - term on this topic and thought it would be appropriate to launch this section with your profile . This is especially topical and relevant considering the rather brutal DIP week ( Dedicated Interview Period ) we had just this past week . . The Journal is published every Monday and we normally try to get the articles before Friday for inclusion . Please let us know what time frame best suits your convenience . We would plan the launch of this new section accordingly . . Once again , thanks very much for your enthusiastic support . . Best Regards , . Ram Vittal . MBA Candidate ( WG '02 ) .

Hi , How is everyone doing ? Busy , Busy , Busy I know . . I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and . several questions have come up . . It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work . . I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with . our banking . Enron Online does not interface with the banking . It . interfaces with a trading system / accounting system ? What I need to know is . what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading . The . accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system . . What it boils down to , is the payment format that we will use to make local . Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the . Japanese - English translation . The accounting system used will need to . interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements , we will need . to interface with the bank . . Please advise . . Thank you , . Pam Perry

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago , and this topic got pushed . aside due to some other pressing issues . However , each of you agreed that a . standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas , power and liquids products . . The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day ( just to get an . idea of the numbers we were talking about , I looked at yesterday to determine . how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time . We had three US Gas . deals , and two Canadian Gas deals ) . After 4pm , the bridges would . automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day . However , for those deals . that do not bridge after 4pm , the various risk groups would need to remember . that these deals are the following day's business . I am not sure how the . procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position . reports , as the official books would not include these late deals . Can Risk . run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions . each morning ? . I would appreciate any comments that you may have , and regardless , please . re - confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups . . Sheri . x36557 . Mike - any potential problems with the DPR ? . Peggy - we discussed briefly a few weeks back . . . any thoughts ?
Chris : . How about Sept 21 ? I have to be in NYC anyway on Sept 20 . Mark
Sorry I missed your call last night . I had a good cry and went to bed early . . As you noted in your voice message , I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday , Dec 15 . It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight ( albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive ) . . Here is the other part of my plans . I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date , unless the stay requirements are very , very short . I can fathom the courage to travel by myself , but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself . Also , all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me . . I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation / VISAs - - including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid - January . That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary . Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements . I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there . Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty . . I am totally terrified about traveling by myself - - but this isn't a fear that will ease with time . I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind . . I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport . Will the assistance service help me at customs ? Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him ? Do I have hotel accomodations ( if so preferrably at the Hyatt ) ? . Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz . I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat . . Shelley Corman . 713 - 853 - 7083

Greetings . Well , it's about over for the company known as Enron . Ultimately I , and just about everyone else , am going to need to find a new job . But it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive . It's a shame that such a fun , interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised ( at a minimum ) extremely poor judgment . But it is what it is . As for me , I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around . I've already had a few calls from """" inquiring minds , """" so we'll we where things end up . Thanks so much for the thoughts . Definitely crazy times , but I'm not getting to worked up about it . And besides , Prentice has accepted PWC's offer , so I'm looking forward to housekeeping ! .

To All : . I have attached an omnibus confirm worksheet for a transaction with this . counterparty . We require a guaranty from their parent .

Now they say they will provide the guaranty . At . the time of the initial transaction they sent over thier format which Shari . Stack reviewed and commented , which I have a copy of . I feel we should . attach a red - line version of this guaranty to the confirm for their review . . Please advise , . Russell .
hey , if i don't see you tonight remind me to tell you something tomorrow .
Gary and Georgeanne let me know that all but 487 shares of EOG are hedged . ( without the EOG leg , the Cerberus total return swap is really only a loan , . and its VaR is about $ 500 thousand ) . I have recalculated , and the total . return swaps VaR fell to $ 34 million in December and $ 18 million in . November . December VaR is still up substantially from November , and the . primary reason now is that since natural gas prices are up so much , the value . of the Bammel Looper and Mid Texas total return swaps has increased . The . more money we make , the more we can potentially lose . . Regards , . Eugenio
Yes , this is as of 2 / 28 / 01 . I've run into another problem . The physical . swaps on the West desk for 7 . 1MM is income . Per my conversation with Kori , . she said that this was a swap with Cross Commodity book . If that is the . case , the Cross commodity book has income of 8 , 738 , 809 that she says is . related to this 7 . 1 deal . Unfortunately , I can't have income on both books . . Is there an offset somewhere that I am not seeing . Which book should be . taking the expense West or Cross Commodity ? . If I'm unable to get this straighten out by tomorrow morning , I will have to . make an accrual of about 15MM on the cross commodity book . Which will need . to be explained in further detail . .

Dear Vince : . I hope you have liked the short paper on decision making I sent you a week ago . It emphasizes the human nature of the process of decision making . I personally believe that this line of reasoning is systematically neglected by the investment and trading communities . I think that many of the great traders and investors are very well aware of these limitations of human mind and are making efforts to utilize them . For example you may encounter similar ideas in the George Soros' book """" The Alchemy of Finance """" . I am certain that developing and expertise in this area bears a tremendous potential for improving Enron's trading operations and will give us an edge with respect to other trading powerhouses . . Do you think there are desks at Enron that may be interested in developing a system of procedures that leads to improving our trading performance ? I will be extremely interested in working in this field . By the way I have already gathered many of the basic pieces of information needed for such an undertaking . . As a beginning I may make an overview of the literature available on decision biases and list as many of them as possible . Indeed , the mind traps mentioned in the paper are not the only ones . Later we may discuss with our clients possibilities for quantifying the influence of a selected group of these biases on the performance of our traders . Still later , a set of questionnaries , a system for keeping trader's perceptions prior to every act of decion making , and the result of the decision will be created , etc . . I envision the final product to be a self - educating trading system learning from every single experience , both positive and negative and utilizing the history of the decision maker to her best benefit . After some transition period , the result should be a more enlightened process of decision making of our traders , stripped as much as possible from the common psychological biases and utilizing human judgment - - the very thing which differentiates the good trader from the computer ( or the bad trader , for that matter ) . . I will highly appreciate your opinion on these issues . . Thank you in advance . . Sincerely yours , . Anguel

Vince , . 1 ) Did you talk to Whalley about Christian Werner ?

Hi Vince , . There has certainly been a lot of """" water over the dam """" since we first discussed your serving as a member of the MSCF Advisory Board last fall .

Dear Managers & Supervisors , . Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC . process . It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions . that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you . supervise . Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their . feedback verbally and in written form . . I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses . and merit increases are given on 2 / 5 / 01 . . Please remember : . All employees in non - bonusable categories must have their performance . evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to . the employee . . Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees . . HR will participate as observers of some reviews . . Let us know how we can assist you , . Your HR Team

Hi Glen : . Good call this AM . Mike Day is in fact writing some comments on behalf of Wild Goose and there may be some interest from other folks to sign on and file jointly . However , Mike won't have something to look at before COB tomorrow , and it's unclear at this point how many folks might sign on . So I think it's prudent to continue drafting TW's comments . As soon as I get something from Mike Day , I'll forward to you so you folks can review . . Best , . Jeff . - -
Rick : . Regarding this call tomorrow : are you going to be on this ? . I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how . the unit commitment process works ( if it is in a centralized fashion ) . . That's fine , but I just wanted to get your own views on this . I wrote this . in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and . effective to put in ASAP . The closer the parallels to working markets ( e . g . . PJM ) the better . That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely , . and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process . However , I see how . people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this . . We can develop some other options ( and they are being proposed in many of . the RTO debates around the country ) , but I don't want us to end up . advocating things that either won't work , are very complicated to design and . implement ( e . g . the California system , with re - dispatch iterations etc . ) , or . just plain don't make sense . I guess the next question is how to present . this to Steve Kean . . Anyway , as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to . have a chat first . I should be in the office most of the afternoon , or you . can reach me on ( 617 ) 513 - 5904 ( cellphone ) . . Seabron

Mark : . Got your voice mail on this . I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy . for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year . . My thoughts are as follows : . 1 ) Policy Scope : I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to . trading as well as origination transactions . As you know , often there is a . very blurry line . . 2 ) Existing Masters : If a master is in place , confirmations will be used for . terms of one month to greater than one year . I don't think it will be . practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there . are material modifications done to the pre - approved confirmation template in . the master , which would require Legal approval in the present state of . affairs . I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated . contracts outside a Master Agreement . . 3 ) Order of Magnitude : We should consider having a dollar figure ( determined . simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or . the Enron financial commitment amount ) , coupled with the one year or greater . term , that would require the additional OGC / AGC approval in order to make . sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts . . I would be happy to discuss this with you further . . Alan
Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we . had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and . here is what we concluded needed to be done : . 1 .

Derrick , no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language . . 3 . Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all . circumstances it will say the following : .

B appoints as its Process Agent , __ , having an office in . ___ on the date of this Agreement at __ . . Susan Bailey , .

Scott .

Hey girls , . Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now . I priced up a 4 day / 3 night trip with air / hotel / car to Albuquerque ( we'd have to drive to Sante Fe . . . not bad , I've done it ) and it came out to about $ 255 a person . Personally , I think this is a really good price . I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go . We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen . Anyway , drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research . I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday . . Talk to you soon , . Sue . P . S . Katy . . . my friend Julie's email address is julieg @ qualcomm . com . I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions .
Liz , . What about suggesting Friday , September 7 for the Santa Fe , Prediction Co , trip ? . Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe . . We could go to Stanford on Thursday , the day before . . Also , they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA . Can you ask Greg if . he wants to participate in the conference call ? I want to propose Friday , 2 : 00 p . m . our time , for . a conference call . Given that they want to discuss the NDA , we could include the lawyer , . Mark Taylor , as well . . Vince . - -
Hi Jeff , . I need more in - depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding , . so I asked around for a Mississippi firm . Sheila suggested this firm , and .

When I open this letter there is nothing there . Can you send again ?
I'm sorry if you misunderstood me , but what I was trying to convey was that . Rev . Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group . by - way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up . the concerns that was given to us in the hand - outs and also anything else . that God lays on our heart . . The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great . Rev . Jacque . mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that . we could be on one accord . I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us . is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not . assembled together on Monday night . . I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on . Wednesday's , there will be some definite strongholds torn down . What do you . think ? . -

This follows up on my voice - mail to you of just a few minutes ago . I reviewed a voice - mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F & J . She has spoken with Scott Josie , apparently one of our business people , and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical , due to market conditions . Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F & J , given the late date . Theresa , please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said . . I see two options : . 1 . If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is : I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today . If I can't , Mariner retains someone else today . Frankly , I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F & J , based on where F & J started . . 2 . If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F & J under the circumstances : I will do my best to get that done by noon or so , and if F & J doesn't budge , we may have to sign the letter as is . . Caveat : I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week , so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly . Also , if we redraft a letter , we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys . . I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz , Mariner's GC , this morning what our game plan is , and if it is option one , have her go ahead and contact her back - up choices of law firms , start running conflicts checks , etc . , and have them be ready to hit the ground running . . If there is anyone else I need to send this e - mail to , please let me know . . I am in all day today ; please let me know what you want me to do . . Britt

Bob , . Further to your last e - mail , just to let you know that I have ordered form . Derek Oliver at the Exchange the package of documents which we shall need to . sign so that : . ECTRI becomes a proprietary trader member on the Exchange . ECTRIC's orders are placed onto the exchange via EEFT in London ( although . EEFT does not become in any capacity a member on the Exchange ) . . As soon as I get them I'll start to check them over . . Derek Oliver at the Exchange needs some clarification as to whether we just . want Steve Kim to be able to place orders onto the Exchange - or whether we . want some back - ups ( e . g . , Martin , Tom , Fraser , etc ) . If you could let me . know , I would be very grateful . . Furthermore , please just confirm that you want E . D . & F Mann to be the . clearer . . Finally , Re the implementation of appropriate trading software in London , . Derek Oliver has said that he is happy for this to be in EEFT's name ( hence . avoiding any chance of ECTRIC having to own this in London and hence avoid . any spectre of ECTRIC having , on this account , a """" permanent establishment """" in . London for tax purposes ) . Whomever you will appoint from the commercial team . to liaise with London IT on the implementation of the software package will . need to speak to me urgently before they do anything . . Kind regards . Mark

Greg ( Adams ) , . Attached is our cash forecast . There are several important points to keep in mind with this forecast : . 1 . This is our best guess at this point . As other business units clarify their business plans , it will affect our activity . Once their plans are set and communicated to us , we can better forecast our numbers . . 2 . This forecast represents the estate only . ( Since that is what we discussed in the meeting on Monday ) We have made no attempt to forecast NETCo since that has already been done and is seperate . . 3 . Infrastructures numbers are somewhat soft due to the Outlook problems experienced yesterday . As they firm up or we get additional information , we can update numbers . . 4 . We have not included any future severance or retainage payments as we discussed . . 5 . I have included a tab which attempts to segregate costs by business unit . Again , this is soft and will be better defined as the business units define their plans . . 6 . I will be out of the office after today for a while . If you have questions after today , contact Mike Galvan ( x3 - 5439 ) or Kevin May ( x5 - 2508 ) . 7 . I have not put this file on the O : drive since it is being emailed . Let me know if I need to . . Kerry ( x5 - 4895 )

Hi Mum ! The trip was pretty exhausting . Friday we saw Hoover Dam , had lunch . at a great diner in Kingman ( on Route 66 ! ) and rolled into Sedona around 5 . . Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday , sat by the pool . in the afternoon and I did some shopping . Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon . and did part of the Bright Angel trail . That was pretty strenuous but . definitely worth it . Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had . Bill's trial schedule to deal with . I'll spare you the details of my trip . home - - suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon . yesterday and have a $ 200 travel voucher for my trouble . .

While I make these changes , please note : . - - why isn't the discount capped at Anticipated Usage any more ? I thought the product capped it .

I assume that covers it . . - - now that we are changing the EESI Energy Price , can there be a delta between the EESI Energy Price and the """" Spot Price """" as defined for this market ( """" the weighted average ( weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile ) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus all non - Utility charges arising from uplifts , installed capacity , ancillary services , congestion , losses and other ISO charges or administrative fees incurred in connection with delivery of energy to the Delivery Point """" ) such that we need charges for excess and deficiency usage ? .

In rereading your email from 11 / 1 / 01 , whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference , as long as , if it's not the survivor , the survivor assumes the obligations . Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described , as long as ( 1 ) the survivor has equal or better or investment - grade credit , which we assume will be the case , ( 2 ) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board , which has occurred , and ( 3 ) Enron survives or the survivor assumes , which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive . . Does any of the recipients disagree ?
Hi Rick , . I just met with Meredith Philipp about our external communcations . She has given me some draft documents for the group that I'll review today . We'll try to get a final version to you by the end of the day . They will address various settings , such as panels and roundtable discussions , as well as media . I think the timing is great , as we are currently the subject of so much interest . It's feeling like we've moved into a period of crisis management , and people in our group may be put on the spot . These documents don't go to the issues of the day - - just general guidelines for our interactions wherever they may be . . I also mentioned to her that people in our group could use a plain - english briefing on what's going on with investors right now , so that they don't sound uninformed when people ask them about it . She agreed that it would be good to give people a briefing , and suggested that maybe Mark or Karen could participate in your call on Friday to do that . Let me know what you think . . Hope DC is more pleasant than 1400 Smith St . is today . Take care , . Sue . Sue Nord . Senior Director . Government Affairs . 713 - 345 - 4196

Sally , . In March of 1999 , ETS companies , Northern Natural Gas ( NNG ) and Transwestern Pipeline Company ( TW ) , signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade ( ECT ) for pricing information . You were the signatory for ECT at that time . These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes . Currently , we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes . However , the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies . I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA / EWS that would handle these duties currently . . Thanks . Vince Strohmeyer . 713 . 853 . 6701
I'm not sure why that shouldn't count . Any trades done can be booked into . RMT and then into ECT if necessary to hedge with third parties .

Question for you guys - because of our past experience and situation I wanted . to have you guys let me know what to do on insurance . . The Gillette office is going to lease a 4 wheel drive vehicle for 1 month . . The lease is through Enterprise and they are asking if we want them to add . insurance . Enron doesn't have a corporate rate for Enterprise . I don't want . to assume anything so should we have them add it or not ? . I am checking into trying to lease from Avis because we do have a rental . agreement with them . . Thanks . Jessica . Car Rental Contracts . Rental car contracts for January 1 , 2000 , through December 31 , 2000 have been . awarded to : . National Car Rental and Avis Rent A Car System , Inc . . When you rent a vehicle from National or Avis under the Contract , the daily . rental rate includes two kinds of insurance : . Avis , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person / $ 300 , 000 per occurrence , and . $ 50 , 000 for property damage . . These coverage's only apply when the vehicle is rented at the contract rate . using the following state contract identifier numbers : . National - 5000838 . Avis - A288200
Stacy / Richard , . Is the data center ( 7210 Ardmore St . ) going under the same deal ? It hasn't been part of the discussion so I'll assume no until I hear back . .

Further to my conversation this evening with David Minns : . The cellphone connection was not good , however , I understand from my . conversation with David that in his opinion , the current GTC would not . preclude an international company from trading with Enron Australia on . Australian Power . . David mentioned that there are regulations which govern trading in Australia , . which require that companies register with the Australian authorities . I . assume , however , that these registration requirements would not apply to the . counterparty if the counterparty were not located in Australia ? ( David , . please confirm ) . . David stated he would call Mark to discuss the GTC and ( presumably ) determine . what action may need to be taken ( if any ) for Monday . . I assume that whatever action is agreed , it will result in a situation in . which international ( non - Australian ) companies can transact with Enron . Australia on Australian financial power and that such action will be . completed prior to Monday's launch . . David / Mark : Please leave me a voice mail on 713 853 1861 or send an email as . soon as the way forward is identified . . Thanks , . Dave

Susan / Tana . Do we have a Master Swap agreement with Credit Lyonnais SA ( country of . registration is France ) ? We recently did a deal with them and the credit . report is stating that a confirm is ok to go out since we have an MS with . them . I looked in your database and it seems that we don't have an MS . Just . wanted to check with you first before doing anything . . Let me know , thanks .
Asset Management is in the process of updating site information and seeking documentation of revenue meter testing at Green Power . Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES . . All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment . If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range , then the utility will calibrate the meter . . I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power . Specifically , I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or . the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site . . If you know of anyone who can assist with this matter , please forward their contact information to me . . Thanks

In re - reading this , I noticed that Todd Hall was included in the distribution list . He is the only one from Brent's team included . Do you want to copy Brent as well , or was Todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR , which now is managed by Susie Ayala . Either way , you may want to include Brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive . . What about Georgeanne Hodges ? Should she be notified as well ? You may also want to copy Wes as an FYI . Thanks .
The practice has been for someone from Enron familiar with the project ( not a . lawyer ) initials each of the pages for both contracts , inlcuding exhibits . .

My comments - - . I assume that in the Enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 12 - 15 - 02 date ? Also , critical to highlight that the FERC should have one """" major """" change date , not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change . . Finally , break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition . Every state inside this region ( except VT ) has competitive retail access . Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business """" easier """" for companies like EES . We should play this up . We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down .

Hydro Quebec is not only a provincial utility , it is owned by the Government . of Quebec and its business and affairs will be governed by Quebec civil law . ( all other jurisdictions in Canada are common law jurisdictions ) which is . generally foreign to non - Quebec lawyers . Also , unless you are uniquely . successful at your negotiations , I expect that HQ will insist on the . guarantee being governed by Quebec law . Accordingly , I agree that Quebec . counsel should be involved in looking at the guarantee and isues of . authority , capacity , execution , delivery , enforceability , etc . In fact a . legal opinion may be appropriate . . As to Quebec counsel , I would suggest the following : . 1 . Andre Vautour @ Desjardins Ducharme Stein Monast in Montreal @ . 514 . 878 . 5595 . Andre acted for us us the Papier Mason transaction and I would . recommend him to you . . 2 . Xeno Martis @ Fasken Martineau DuMoulin in Montreal @ 514 . 397 . 7509 .

McKinsey : I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today . Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade - offs relative to that . Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey . What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with . We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey . . Staff Meeting Attendees : Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting ? Does he know about it for this week ? Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make - up of that meeting ? We are including Mark's directs on IT , but not their counter parts in Operations . Including operations would make that meeting too big , so I am not necessarily suggesting that . Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have . ( FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today , Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC . Creates a bit of a bumpy start . Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired , . I can share those with you . Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition . ) . Budgets : After meeting with Whalley last week , should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars ( expense and capital ) of 10 % or so ? That has not been our goal to date , but maybe it should be , given the stretch that Greg is trying to make . Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves . I have some ideas on how we might get there . Let me know - we would need to get that done this week . - - Sally

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow . I will coordinate with him on org charts . Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading ?

Let me give you my thoughts . . We acquired MGT on April 30 . If you include O & M expenses prior to that period of time you will be including all of the MGT salaries , allocations and overheads for which we had no responsibility . . El Paso , through the transition services agreement , is performing the accounting functions for MGT . Each month someone in my department provides to them actual expenses paid through Enron that need to be recorded as O & M on MGT . These are additive to those expenses processed through the El Paso system . . I believe you should be picking up actuals from May 1 forward . . - -

After we get the revision back from LeBoeuf tomorrow , it would be good if you . requested a meeting date for next week when you forward it .

Dear Mr Kean , . Thank you for your reply . Ultimately I intend to return to Australia , and I . regularly monitor the on - going developments taking place in the Australian . power market ( as well as the converging natural gas market ) . I will . endeavour to contact Mark next week and hopefully discuss Enron's activities . in Australia and areas in which I may be able to contribute . . As I mentioned in my previous email , I am also hopeful of gaining further . experience in international energy markets , particularly the US . I think my . experience and contacts among Asia Pacific countries , and the skills I've . developed , can be applied to the North American market and that I could . offer a very positive contribution to Enron either on the regulatory or . commercial side . . As I am being married in the US this July , and am able to obtain an . appropriate ( non - expat ) working visa , I would be very interested in suitable . opportunities with Enron either in Houston or other parts of the US . Do you . believe that I am being realistic in pursuing opportunities in the US market . or should I rather concentrate on the Australian market ? . Thank you again for your assistance in this matter . . Yours sincerely , . Alastair L . Stevenson . Energy Economist ( Australia ) . Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre ( APERC ) . - -

Hunter , I spoke with Heather Purcell who is kind of like the intermediate between IT and business in terms of web based commodity information . Basically I informed her that CF was now being released to the gas trader / originators and showed her the message board features for each commodity ( have a look on the site . . very cool ) . . Anyway , when I proposed to her that it would be in her interest to encourage her users to use CF , and that it will not allow a single point of reference for weather information etc . I experienced immediate resistance . Heather basically informed me that her boss , Shankman would not be using the site because it did not contain the power information ! ! My response was why not use the site at least to facilitate the communication between crude + gas in the mean - time , basically integral markets . . . . . anyway , I think the basic problem is that Heather et al have spent a great deal of time + money on the design of all 10 or so EGM sites ( prob over 100k ) , and now her is one site that does it all and more ! ! ! . I know you realize the issues , but for this to be a completely effect tool for the traders , we really need buy in from EGM . I appreciate Heather's resistance , however you can't stop progress . . What do you think ? ? . - Colin

As a family , we own an approximate $ 700 million in Exxon stock and maintain excellent relationships with several investment banks . . My mother , Sandra Mosbacher , myself , my brother , as well as my Aunt Caroline Law have all been actively following Enron's situation and are available to help in any way we can . . Sincerest regards , . Bobby Gerry
Please let me know if this request is OK ? . Thanks , . Stephanie . -
Hi Katie , Looks like you got the address right . I too enjoyed talking with . you last night . I know you were disappointed to be distracted from your . research project for a while . . Its been a busy week so far . The end of the yearly quarter always is . Last . minute deals have to be closed to book the income . At this time of year the . commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says """" I have got to get . this project done or I am out of here """" . March 31 can't arrive soon enough . . Got any big plans for the weekend ? Hanging out at the Dixie Chicken or is . that only where rookies hang out ? . Take care and I'll talk to you later . . Gerald .

You and all of Enron are in our prayers . If I can I'd like to share a verse that found its way to me during my morning prayer time . I hope it blesses you as well . . Psalm 121 ( 1 - 3 ) I lift up my eyes to the hills where does my help come from ? My help comes from the Lord , the Maker of heaven and earth . He will not let my foot slip . . I have prayed that God will stay close to your side and let you know that his works are most powerful when we need him the most . . God Bless . Cb . - -

Mike , I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the . presenters . Apparently , Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the . presenters was inaccurate ; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you . would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the . SUN demonstration . . With Jeff out of town until Monday , I would really like to have someone . contact the presenters before the end of the week . Is this going to be . possible ? I'll call you tomorrow to follow up . In the meantime , below are . the links to the presenters' bios , which I believe include their phone . numbers . Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them . . Additionally , I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we . have to date . I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to . reconsider the buffet idea , with seating scattered around the facility , and . the meeting room set up """" class room """" style . If we go with the plated . breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 """" 10 - tops , """" there will be no . space for a screen , podium , AV equipment , etc . If we have more than 120 . people ( I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing . to come in ) , we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting . room . In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the . YPO group , I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and . will walk in just in time for the presentations . I think you guys and Jeff . are scheduled to meet next Tuesday , so perhaps that can be discussed then . . I'll give you a call tomorrow , Mike .

Jo Williams left me a message this morning requesting that during the morning gas control meeting that when allocations are announced that the shippers that were cut be given without Marketing asking for the information . . I had this information this morning but no one asked for it . . I told Jo someone had been coming to the meetings with that information available and it had been given out when asked for but she failed to remember that . I guess we should just announce who got cut when we talk about the allocations and if it gets to be too much information Marketing will let us know . . John Buchanan
I just talked to Chris Kennedy , she informed me that Amoco will be taking down their liquids line that feeds the Wattenberg plant for the entire months of August and September . What that means is that the gas flows into CIG at Watkins / Box Elder will be reduced . She says by 15 % but I don't know if that's entirely correct . This hurts us on the Thermo deal , delivered to Skyline , due to the fact that these two receipt points are the only points that work on our discounted transportation . I don't think we will have too much trouble buying DJ supplies during the peak of the summer but keep your eyes open for any Watkins / Box Elder supply . We also need to start working CIG for a discount on other receipt points . . Paul . PS Make sure if you are using the CIG Skyline DISCOUNTED transportation at receipt points other than Watkins and Box Elder we are requesting discounts for these additional points . Otherwise we will be paying max rate !
Jane , . - could you let me know what the Japanese lawyers think of John's argument . that this deal is to hedge weather risk arising in the ordinary course of our . Japanese business . Seems to me that we honestly believe this to be the case , . even though it is too early in the development of our Japanese business to . prove it today . Perhaps we should change """" arising """" to """" which will arise """" ? . Does that help ? . - if that is not a runner , all Mark Taylor's suggestions seemed eminently . sensible . Do those work ? How about booking the deal from Australia ? Tax . issues ? Does where the deal is booked override the fact that the telephone . call was made within Japan ? . - if none of these work , then cancelling the deal ( even if the counterparty . is willing ) must be the least attractive answer as it is effectively . acknowledging fundamental ( possibly insuperable ) regulatory issues with the . weather derivatives trading in Japan . . - the other things I would want to understand before reaching a decision . would be : . - how have other derivatives traders in Japan dealt with this issue ? ( I . presume this is not a problem unique to weather and must have been . addressed before in Japan as it has in most other jurisdictions ) . - how grey an area is this ? If we take a reasonable position in this grey . area , how real is the risk of both the grey area being resolved against us . and criminal sanctions then being invoked against us ? . - following up on Mark's idea , could we not reduce the ( hopefully already . minimal ) risk of criminal sanctions by going after the event with clean . hands to the regulator for an answer . We have done exactly that on a similar . issue which arose in the Netherlands recently . . I hope that helps . Could we please discuss this on the phone before a . decision is made . . Thanks . .

I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to God . I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us , or cares for that matter . I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re - runs , he looks down on our little planet form his lay - z - boy and selects one of us at random , throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we handle it . Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air their dirty laundry on T . V . Then again maybe not . . I hope all is well . Glad you like the new job . . JON

As you are aware , NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding . Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in - kind balancing or cash out . Also , the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account . Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co - chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG . I assume you are OK with this assignment . . We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort . Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room . Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 - 1 / 12 hours ? . I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer . . Let me know . . Thanks ! . Mike McGowan

Jeff , I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a . minute discussing a couple of topics . First and foremost , I wanted to . introduce Genesis Park which is a """" new economy """" investment company that's . been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby , Fred Lummis , Steve . Gibson , Peter Shaper , Bruce Herzog and myself . Paul and I were hoping to . have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to . describe in person what we're all about . And to be clear , we're not looking . for Enron money , we are raising money from private individuals . We've . already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the . Enron / Genesis business relationship . . I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and . whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity . Frankly , I think Vitol is . an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the . last year or two will make it a bit more difficult . They have an . unbelievable franchise , but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which . could be exploited to Enron's benefit . I'm shooting in the dark here but . hopefully it's worth some discussion . . If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet , it would . be greatly appreciated . Paul and I could come to your office , or possibly . you could come to our """" offices """" over on Hermann Park . We're buying 17 acres . on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop . into a technology park . For the time being , we are officing in a high tech . shed on the property ! . Please let me know . Thanks / Neil .
We are at the MOU stage . Need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and . emphasized in a commercial meeting last Friday . Commercial leads at ENA and .

Attached is the latest weekly report . You should notice a significant . increase in forecast by the amount of the Acceleration for each project . ( previously shown as Unapproved trend changes , not included in forecast ) . totaling $ 21 . 5 million . I am currently working with the developers to . revise the forecast for the ENA expenses for such items as Spare Parts and . Interconnect Costs . . The report does reflect Nepco payments through June with an Estimate to . Complete . However the report does not show actuals by budget line item for . the NEPCO reimbursables for May ( Gleason and Wheatland ) or June . Mike . Miller and I are currently working with EECC trying to resolve three issues , . one of which are timely accurate reports . . Dave , . I did receive an invoice from EECC for the $ 9 million fee for the 2000 . projects , which I think Mike forwarded to you . Let me know if I need to . include the fee , previously pulled out , in the forecast . . Thanks Amy 3 - 7805
Jeff : . About a month ago Ken received a reply from a small business owner in CA to . his business outreach letter . In it , the business man expresses concern . about high natural gas prices and asks if owning part of a pipeline is a . solution . I have drafted the attached , and it has gone through Janel . . Could you please do a quick review , and then I will pass on to Steve ? We . hope to get this out ASAP as Ken received the letter nearly one month ago . . Thanks , . Jennifer

Hey there ! . Sounds like someone decided to remain in bed for a little longer this . morning ? I was actually running really late myself . I didn't get in until . close to 9 : 00 . Not what I was planning on doing this morning . . I have been working on a daily revenue report all morning trying to make sure . that it goes out with the correct information . Don't want to have another . day like yesterday ! . So , sounds like you a crazy day has already started for you . Good luck . . Hope you don't have to work too late tonight . By the way , what time are you . coming over tonight ? Thought I would be the one to ask ! Ha ! . Have a good morning . . . . just tell all those clients that you'll get the stuff . to them on your own time and they can just sir back and relax !
Bo thanks for the info . I will review later . At first glance it looks like . they didn't take too much out . Please note their Exhibit A is wrong . Either . ENA or Enron Compression Services is the Company ( or Customer whichever case ) . and EES should be one or the other . . Maybe we can get together tomorrow or Thursday , whichever fits your schedule . . Christy
I have a meeting with Dave on Monday at 8 : 30am .

As a side note you may have heard that . Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in . the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one . priority . As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as . to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant . ( Dave's call . obviously ) . Thanks again . . . . . - -
I was approached by an attorney ( in Texas ) whose firm represents the CA . Legislature in studying energy - related issues and was asked why Enron ( or . any other retail marketer ) is not advocating benefits of dereg on behalf of . the end - user .

I may be able to get more . detail if you are interested .

Vincent , . We met last year when you were visiting The University , and talking . primarily with our finance faculty . As you may have heard , I tried to call . to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real . options from your group at Enron . Naturally , I would be delighted if you . could speak , but I could also appreciate the possibility that someone else . might also be a good choice . . I have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information . . This is the first time this course has been offered at UT , and I was . motivated to do so because of the """" buzz """" regarding the topic in industry . I . have about 30 MBA students in the class , many of whom were in the energy . finance classes offered by Sheridan Titman and Ehud Ronn ( both of whom have . been very supportive of the development of this class ) . My own background . is decision analysis rather than finance , so I tend to approach the topic . with that perspective . As you can see , I have covered both traditional . decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature . At the . present time , I don't think there is a really complete textbook that fits . the course at the MBA level , so I've tried to focus on how to do things in . practice , and have provided software ( DPL , spreadsheets , @ Risk , etc ) as . tools for the students to use . . The course is scheduled on Thursday afternoons from 3 : 30 to 6 : 30 , . which is a time that I chose to make possible the participation of some . Executive MBA students from Houston ( 3 are participating ) . I look forward . to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker , or any other . suggestions that you might have . . James S .

How about this . . . . There was no recognizable change in counterparties . No one significant has dropped off . We can't identify individuals who might not be transacting with us . The transaction volume is still within the normal range , given the normal daily and counterparty variability ( 30 - day rolling average of more than 5 , 500 transactions with a notional value of more than $ 2 . 7 billion ) . . As reported in the 10Q , while trading volumes in our core natural gas and power business have held steady , there has been some decrease in wholesale trading volumes in a few of our non - core businesses . Additionally , due to the unusual events of the last few weeks , we have seen some decrease in the number of long - term transactions . ( Long - term deals are often completed off - line and would not appear in EOL numbers ) .

George and Webb , please find attached revision one to the Santee Cooper O & M . cost estimate . It is for mobilization and operating period O & M services for . one gas fired , 5 x LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility located at the . Georgia and South Carolina border . . The revision made adjustments to the following : . Rev 0 Rev 1 . Mobilization fee $ 90 , 000 $ 200 , 000 . Annual Operating fee $ 160 , 000 $ 250 , 000 . Annual Maintenance cost Estimate $ 405 , 000 $ 593 , 000 . Mobilization Labor cost ( adjusted benefits ) $ 175 , 000 $ 193 , 000 . Annual Labor cost ( adjusted benefits ) $ 406 , 000 $ 450 , 000 . Initial Spare Parts $ 1 , 320 , 000 $ 1 , 300 , 000 . My reasoning is this : . 1 . After consulting with OEC , the previous fees were not believed to be at . """" market """" . . 2 . Annual Maintenance was recalculated after having more time to do a bottom . up estimate . . 3 . Mob and annual labor costs changed due to a change in OEC benefits . calculations . . 4 . Initial spares rounded down . . As we discussed , the GT major maintenance is scheduled to occur in year 18 of . an 18 year term . . Please provide your comments . . regards , Scot

Group , . Ryan sent this email out once already , here it is again . The oasis site map is http : / / www . nwoasis . org / OASIS / NODE . The details of checking for ATC are as such Red = PAC ( t ) , Blue = IPC ( t ) . Leg 1 . PACW to ENPR . Leg 2 . ENPR to BOBR . Leg 3 . BOBR to PATHC . Leg 4 . PATHC to PACE . Leg 5 . PACE to FC3 . We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well . . When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC ( t ) be sure to just put in the POR / POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately . This will prevent us from being charged $ 5 . 84 each time . Total cost for this tranny should be $ 5 . 84 + $ 2 . 38 + $ 5 . 84 = $ 14 . 06 . There will also be losses . If using this wheel for a services customer , be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees . Also , be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished , otherwise we will be locked out if we time out ! There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345 . This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days . . Please see me with questions . . Thanks , . Bill . - -

Depends on how the deals were entered originally . If the sum of both deals . will make up the total expense that will be paid to pipeline , then the . waivers / discounts need to be included on both tickets . If the tickets have . been entered by some other method , a review might be necessary . . Even though we know that we will pay the pipeline based on the net activity . across all deals , each deal will be treated independently in Unify when . determining the expense . If two deals are entered assuming the tariff rate . applies , then later one deal is modified to a negotiated price , only the . volumes that are moved on the negotiated price deal will be valued this way , . the volumes that move on the other ticket will still be valued at tariff rate . . Hope this helps . . SRM . Chris Germany . 05 / 04 / 2000 03 : 38 PM . To : Scott Mills / HOU / ECT @ ECT , Thomas Engel / HOU / ECT @ ECT , Dave .

Competition under electric deregulation some way off . May . 30 , 2001 . Associated Press Newswires . Copyright 2001 . The Associated Press . All Rights Reserved . . CONCORD , N . H . ( AP ) - In theory , New Hampshire's electric industry is . deregulated and ready for competition . . Rates are down for customers of Public Service Company of New Hampshire , the . state's largest utility , but not because of competition . The rates were cut . because of a deal struck between the governor and the utility , ending a long . legal battle . . So far , only two potential energy suppliers have registered with the Public . Utilities Commission to sell electricity in the state , but neither is yet set . up to do so . . The Campaign for Ratepayers Rights , which is pursuing a U . S . Supreme Court . appeal to overturn the deregulation agreement , went to Merrimack County . Superior Court last week to have the agreement invalidated . . The nonprofit group's lawsuit says the state deregulation law requires that . customers have a choice of """" viable suppliers , """" and despite two years of . effort , there is still no choice . . Joshua Gordon , the lawyer who filed the suit for the group , said the PUC . acknowledged in a letter to the group's president , Robert Backus , that there . is no choice among electricity suppliers . . """" Competition will not occur all at once , or appear solely as the result of . regulatory actions taken or avoided . Markets need time to develop and . emerge , """" the PUC wrote . . """" We've gone through several years now and all kinds of litigation to get . competition , and bailed out PSNH for $ 2 billion in the name of customer . choice , and we still don't have it , """" Gordon said . . Rates have dropped 15 percent since last September for Public Service . customers , and those rates will remain low because of the transition period . factored into the state's bargain with the utility , said Amanda Noonan , the . PUC's director of consumer affairs . . The transition period , planned originally for 33 months , has been extended by . the Legislature to 57 months . Public Service rates will rise gradually during . that time , the idea being that rate increases will spur consumers to find . other electricity suppliers . . Noonan says she believes few companies will enter the market until those . rates rise .

In anticipation of your meeting tomorrow , I have attached a summary of . Enron's credit exposure to PG & E Corp and its affiliates as of Friday , January . 5th . I will be happy to provide you updated numbers if necessary in the AM . . Please call if you have any questions . . Bill
Gloria , . I'm sorry but as a manager , I spent the vast portion of my days and evenings . involved in trading activities , in meetings and trying to put out fires . I . have also been receiving on average 2 or 3 of these requests per day and I . usually don't even begin looking at these until 6 in the evening . Some are . quick fixes , but the majority lately have not been . Todays calendar isn't . looking much better . . I contacted Wade on this last week , but have not received anything . I hate . to hold you back from making your payments , which is why we have spent . another good chunk of time justifying a new position under Carrie Hollomon to . handle these types of requests . That position is now to be filled by Teri . Franklin . I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as . sitara , so please continue to be patient for awhile . . So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster , I would like to . suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade . and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri . . If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from . setting up deals with incorrect pricing . Which then causes us to have to go . back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the . error , which is exactly what I received an . email on earlier this morning . . Teri , . If you need any help with sitara or any other type of training in setting up . these deals , please let either myself , Victor , Chris , or Brenda know and we . will try to answer your questions . Thanks for your help ! . Kathy . Gloria G Barkowsky . 03 / 07 / 2000 10 : 38 AM
Kay , here's the near to last draft of the form . Sorry of the delay and . thanks for being a sport about it , especially when your dvelope rtypes are . needig to get on down the road . . Please feel free to work on this , but . please don't distribute this as our form , as you can see from the note . below that we still have a way to go before it is the """" form' , but remaining . work is limited to speific content here and there , typos , and some . litigation sturff . The structure will remain , so you can safely work into . this the West LB stuff . . John R . asked that you and he have a chat about the directionyou are . headedand hwo to coordinate the changes that need to be made - in terms of . substance as awell as drafting - to get to an standard set of changes for . the off balance sheet work . I would be glad to participate . . -

Michael , . I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options . Unfortunately , they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future . The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place . They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options . . It was worth a try . . Phillip
Jim , . Well , you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner . You did an outstanding job ( as did Carrin ) , and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart . I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention , but it comes with the territory . It sure made me proud to see you up there , and congratulations on the accomplishment . . Scotty
Karen - I will ask legal to forward you the draft of the loan document as . soon as it becomes available . I expect it by the end of this week . If that . changes I will let you know . As for your question regarding the amount , the . worksheet is simply an attempt to capture the potential maximum needs based . on certain assumptions . Depending on the positions we have in place , the . various business lines could offset each other , but they could also be . additive . I tried to pick a middle ground for my request so that there is a . realistic expectation of what the potential needs could be . As for Global . Finance , Sarah is back in the office so she will be handling the FASH . . Lastly , I am currently assuming that the Peoples loan will mirror our loan . with identical caps . However , we have not presented a draft to Peoples yet . for their review so they may have other ideas which they have not . communicated yet . . Thanks , . Gregg

I have just heard ? from a member of AReM ? that Linda Serizawa , Commissioner . Wood's advisor , has stated that Commissioner Wood is at this moment drafting . the decision on direct access . ? She indicated that a draft order would be . released , but would not say when . ? She stated that ABX1 - 1 directed the CPUC . to set a date at which time a customer would no longer have the right to . switch to an ESP , and indicated that this order , as it is currently drafted , . establishes that date . ? Apparently there was great hesitancy when making the . statement """" as it is presently drafted , """" indicating that Wood is getting a . lot of pressure not to set the date . ? . It seems that now is the time for WPTF , and its member companies , to exert . as much influence as possible on Bilas , Duque and Brown to ask that the . order be held until such time as the Legislature first has the opportunity . to correct ABX1 - 1 . ? . ? . ? .

Jeff , . I reviewed your revised offer sheet . I am OK with the effective income of $ 484K . Her records show basically no other income ( $ 75 / month ) , so I subtracted $ 3 , 000 from your number . The expenses just need to reflect $ 20 , 000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on . $ 484 less $ 244 would be $ 240 of NOI . I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon . He feels this property would most likely warrant 7 . 5 % and a 30 year amortization . See the attached spreadsheets .

Ben , . Blotter has a selection that needs to be checked in order to display EOL deals . . The system shows that you don't have that check box checked . . If that's the problem than all that you need to do is to check that box : . 1 . In Blotter use the """" Clear """" button to clear any deals that may already show . . 2 . Go to """" Defaults """" on the menu . . 3 . Select the only option there ( """" Startup / New Deals Defaults . . . """" ) . 4 . Make sure you have """" Show EOL Deals """" checked . . If this is not the issue , please give me a call at 5 - 7265 . . Thanks ! . Nikolay .
See below . this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps , . because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west . . In addition , if you get questions from the analysts on """" reregulation """" or . price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many . markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create . opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services . . . even a . $ 250 price cap is 5 - 10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying . . -
Well if you're still there , I hope the studying is going well . Malo means . bad . I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system . . The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today ( she usually does Socal ) and . either Ted or I was going to fill in for her . Neither of us wanted to do it , . and Ted got stuck with it . Well . . . I would have done it , but I was out until . 2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it . Socal can be . high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most . expensive gas in the country . Anyway , a bunch of shit got fucked up . It's . not Ted's fault , but he really had a rough day because of it . I think I . might have been able to do a better job , but I knew there was chance for . error because neither of us have done it in a while . I feel bad . . Regardless , I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home . Of . course , I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to ! . Anwyay , it looks like I'm about done here , so I have one last word for . you . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Adios .

As a result of a smooth launch and market demand , we are accelerating the . timetable for the launch of several EnronOnline products . . Specifically , after the launch of U . S . power on Monday , Dec . 13th , we will . be launching the following : . Wednesday , December 15 : US Coal , U . S . Plastics , US Pulp and Paper . Thursday , December 16 : Norwegian Power . Although the legal review has been completed for all of the above , I would . appreciate it if you would look once more at the products which are relevant . to your area and confirm that you are happy with them ( some of you are . already in the process of doing so - thank you ) .

Although formally only two AEP entities are party to the MNA , AEPSC is . acting as agent for a number of affiliates . This raises , to my mind at . least , the possibility that those subsidiaries would be considered the real . """" debtors """" for UCC purposes . . Accordingly , I believe the prudent course is to file against each named . subsidiary , as well as against AEPSC and AEPSI . To do so , we will need . the subsidiaries' respective addresses , jurisdictions of organization and . """" organizational ID """" number ( if organized in Colorado , Delaware , Maryland or .

We had been in discussions with SCE a few months back to remove the QF . requirement in their Rule 21 . At the time they said they """" could """" not . because the construct of their standby rate did not provide adequately . provide recovery for standby service ( particularly for non - demand related . tariff schedules ) . The rejection was were we left the subject with SCE . . Their move to submit an advice letter on the subject comes as a surprise . to me given their prior response . . We will not be protesting with the presumption that the standby tariff . would not prejudice future work on standby tariff rate design . Generally . speaking , the QF requirement is ridiculous and should be removed . immediately . For this reason , we are supportive of it happening now . through this advice filing . I do not want to see the prohibition against . non - QF facilities for up to another 9 months ( rough estimate based on . time - frame articulated in the DG order ) . .

WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 ( the ISO is asking to . be able to buy power for itself in the forward market ) . I agreed to fund as . did 4 , maybe 5 , others . The discussion was not exactly as you describe below . but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing , and am sure I can get . the points included . Therefore , I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate . filing on this . . Here is what WPTF voted on : Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the . super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require . that the price caps end in 6 months ; if the ISO wishes to renew the price . caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6 - month deadline . .

To be clear , Fred is not saying below that that the """" eye - rolling """" expresses . his or EECC's view of the claim , but he is in fact expressing support for . Kay's view of the claim .

I figured we all needed a break from all the 9 / 11 and Retaliation news we've received lately . . To get everyone in the postseason frame of mind here is a trivia question I'm sure will stump the most avid basebvall fan . . There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each position ( center field has two ) , including at pitcher . Name them . . I will share the answers in a future email . I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo are the only ones who have half a chance at this one . Prove me wrong . . Pitcher : . Catcher : . First Base : ( no it was not Rich Kampmann ) . Second Base : . Third Base : . Short Stop : . Left Field : . Center Field : . Right Field : . . Do You Yahoo ! ? . NEW from Yahoo ! GeoCities - quick and easy web site hosting , just $ 8 . 95 / month .

I have added a cycle '0' to all pipelines in the database . . . per our discussion , this cycle will be used only in an 'emergency' type situation ( we didn't scrape any data ( for whatever reason ) , and there is some available that can be manually entered ) . By being '0' , this also shouldn't affect the logic of Yan's reports , since he pulls the latest cycle available ( read the largest number ; if ANY scraped data gets in the DB , it will be returned in place of any cycle 0 data ) . . Any questions , feel free to ask . . . . Chris

Kay : . I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues : . 1 . I requested copies of the note , security agreement and the . non - disturbance lien document . She said they will be using a securities . account with a securities intermediary structure ( UCC Article 8 concept ) . rather than a non - disturbance lien . She said they are working on these . documents and will furnish as soon as possible . . 2 . I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory . . 3 . I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent , such that the GE . acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical . issues . She is considering this . . 4 . She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is . consistent with Enron's discussions with GE , as she needs to get this to GE . as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday . 4 / 20 . The GE letter agreement ( agreeing to the form of all of the . documents ) must be signed this Friday 4 / 20 before the lenders will advance . funds , as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding . Please . advise on this issue . . I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement . within a half hour or so . I reminded him of the need for a W - 9 and an . incumbency certificate to open the escrow account . ( Estelle Lawrence has . also called looking for the escrow agreement ) . . Carolyn M . Campbell .

Looks good to me . The only difference I had was on the last question . . Since municipal bond interest is taxable on the book income , but not on the . irs income : . book income - irs income = 100 , 000 - 70 , 000 = 30 , 000 , of which 25 , 000 is from . municipal bond interest , the other 5 , 000 is from additional depreciation exp . deducted from the irs income . . AARON , KELLY and MICHAEL are the only ones signed up for tonight . Let them . know if you still want to meet . I will be over in Berkeley studying . tonight . ( Maybe I'll cruz by the Wells Fargo room at 7 : 30 and grab a . burrito ! ) . See you guys tomorrow ! . - -

Chaz and Steve , . Here's the latest , in a nutshell . Basically , the testing is not fully . completed , even where we might have felt that it was close ( because there is . also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the . purchase decision ) . As you know , both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out . on vacation , so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas . . However , it looks like there has been enough feedback to / through them to . surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation . . In a meeting today , it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with . the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at . EBS . The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema . Manager tool , and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim , . especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation . . Still , the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential . vendor ; but neither is there a commitment ( written OR verbal ) to make a BMC . purchase at this point . I will be on vacation next week , but will be . checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th . Jennifer or I will keep . you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor . . I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to . me . The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net . Works teams in question : more testing , but looks like BMC's total sales . opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your . deal done . The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from . yesterday still apply . . Thank you , . Jeff . - -

Steve , . We are still in the final preparations for the hearing tomorrow . . Here is the information that I have available right now about ripple claims . . Order of Magnitude . Obviously the amount of the net ripple claim is determined by the . reference price that is used . We have done the calculations for three . different reference prices : ISO ( August 9th ) , Seattle ( """" Fair Price """" ) and . Tacoma ( """" Market Price ) . The net ripple claims under these different . reference prices range from $ 125M ( ISO ) to $ 370 ( Seattle ) . The gross amount . of Enron's ripple claims is from $ 1 . 2B to $ 3 . 1B . . I have asked for a counterparty breakout of rippleclaim estimates from . Charles River and should have that for you tomorrow . . If you have questions , you can reach me on my cell phone a ( 415 ) 279 - 2770 . . Thanks . Gary . - -

About the GPC / ECS contract , we are trying to determine if GPC has a claim of confidentiality that they believe would prevent ECS from disclosing some or all of the contract without their approval . ECS has no objection to producing the contract and I hope that we can get this resolved quickly . . Enjoy your weekend . . Bill .

Mary , . We recently spoke with Joe Fontaine of New Hampshire to find out . what the state is planning for its NOx trading program in 2003 . . New Hampshire is in the OTR NOx trading program but is not . included in the SIP call . New Hampshire had considered opting in . to the SIP call program in 2003 but that seems unlikely now . . There is a possibility that it will opt in in 2006 , but that is also . unlikely . The state plans to keep its individual trading program and . has already amended the state program for 2003 - 2005 . NH units . will be able to buy allowances from SIP states , but cannot sell NH . allowances to be used for SIP compliance elsewhere . . The state is currently arguing with EPA because they believe they . should automatically receive OTR allowances for 2003 , since the . SIP call was pushed back by the court . It is unclear what will . happen to NH in 2003 , but it appears that EPA is not planning to . give the state allowances if officials do not opt in to the SIP call . . EPA proposed an unofficial budget to NH should it decide to opt in , . however state officials greatly objected to the growth factor used , . saying they were much too small . The proposed budget was . around 2 , 200 allowances and the current OTC budget is 3 , 700 . . Based on our conversation it also sounds like officials are . displeased that they were excluded from the 3 state MOU between . CT , RI and MA as a result of their exclusion from the SIP Call .

I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed working with you . I . loved the Company and what it stood for . I think it stood for the . right things and in the end those right things will win the day - - . even in California - - it just may take a long time . I had a great . time working for Enron , and the Government Affairs organization , . built by you and Rick , was truly awesome . It was an honor to work . with you . . But on a personal note , I was shocked and disappointed to be one of . those chosen to be terminated Monday . Further , I think what the . Company is doing to all its laid - off employees is beyond despicable . . It was a total slap in the face to be terminated with no severance - - . the $ 4500 is a slap in the face - - basically a week's pay for me . I . wish those in charge paid as much attention to """" enron's values """" as . its employees did . . I'm getting beyond my anger now . I plan to be an independent . consultant - - that way I can never be fired again ! I'll let you know . how it goes . . Take care . . Sue

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning . Have begun to see short - term intraday topping patterns . Natural has reached its mid - range of price objectives . See no rationale for holding significant length here . Winter months seem especially high and most vulnerable to correction . The first hour's negative close produced a sell signal against today's high . Still too early to ascertain if this is the end of entire up move . Have targets into early next week , but mkt . has reached where it needed to .

Since Bruce Ferrel , the designated system administrator for Enron , is no . longer with your company I am addressing this issue to you . We obviously . need to change the administrator of the system as soon as possible . In . addition , I have sent over the new appendix's we spoke about yesterday to . your attention . . Today we had a situation where Dick Jenkins ( Enron employee ) hit a flat GDD . bid at Transco Z - 6 for Dec 2000 . He actually was logged in under Scott . Hendrickson's ID . Soon after the trade occurred , Mr . Jenkins called and . informed me that he had made a mistake and that he wanted the deal . cancelled . I informed him of the Manifest Error penalty associated with that . step . By the way the penalty associated with a manifest is $ 15 , 000 . Mr . . Jenkins informed me that he wanted the trade cancelled but would not pay the . fee . . The Amendment to the Subscription Agreement dated June 23 , 1999 describes . the Manifest Error process and all fees associated with it . Altra enforces . this language on all subscribers to the system in order to ensure the . integrity of our trading platform . . If you have any questions , please call me at 713 - 210 - 8278 . .

I do not believe the Alaghband issue was researched for the first deal ; however , the two deals are vastly different from each other . The first deal ( with Webco JV ) was a 1 year inventory management deal in which we had title to the product the entire time . That risk profile contrasts sharply with a 15 year option with a $ 40MM unsecured loan . Per our London team , the deal does not break even until year 7 , and much of the value is in the tail . Clearly , a higher level of due diligence should be required . . Additionally , Paul Maley does not have pro - forma data on the merged Balli - Klockner entity - just a company prepared presentation . Balli is purely a trading company , and it is our understanding that Klockner is largely the same ; the new entity is projected to be extremely leveraged . . Please let me know if you have additional questions . . Thanks , . Tanya . - -

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO , LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina . As we discussed Chris , Section 5 . 03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice , the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS . Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is , the original notes will need to be cancelled . Nora , can locate these originals . . I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct . I pulled these from the agreement . Need to verify .

Hi , . My name is Iris Mack . Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk . . I am primarily responsible for building our business in long - term , derivatives structures / trades on multiple commodities and financials . For example , we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power , gas , crude oil , weather derivatives , metals , etc . Some of the building blocks for these multi - commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document . . We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible . Hence , it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi - commodity derivatives trades / structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients . . Thank you in advance for your assistance . . Kind regards , . Iris Mack , MBA / PhD . Enron Power Options Trading Desk

Gregg : . We should register Midwest Energy Hub , L . L . C . ( """" Midwest """" ) for Sales & Use Tax . in those states in which Midwest has nexus . Nexus requires a physical . presence ( employees or inventory ) . If Midwest , in foreign states ( outside of . Illinois ) , is merely purchasing and selling natural gas , for delivery by . common carrier ; Midwest does not have nexus . Rather , Midwest is acting much . like a mail order seller . . In light of the above , could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical . presence in Iowa , Indiana , Kansas , Louisiana , Michigan , Oklahoma , Texas and . Wisconsin .

I got a call from Dow Jones today about a price we had posted on EnronOnline . for day - ahead power at Mead for $ 105 / MWh ( the FERC proxy price is $ 91 . 87 ) . I . talked to Tim Belden and just because an offer is posted doesn't mean that . there's been a transaction . Turns out that under our interpretation of the . FERC order , because Friday for Monday transactions exceed the 24 - hour . delivery requirement , we believe they're exempt from the order . Tim said . that at the end of today , we had done five transactions above the cap , but . they decided to lower the transaction price to the proxy price so we'd reduce . any further exposure and scrutiny .

Based on recent discussions with several energy firms , there appears to be . interest in conducting a survey which . * 	 summarizes the current state of risk management best practices . within the industry , and . * 	 provides benchmark data addressing current levels of risk based . performance for various energy related lines of business . To respond to this interest , we would like to conduct a survey which . addresses these goals . We have prepared a proposal which outlines our . approach for conducting a survey , and provides samples of expected output . I . will be in touch sometime next week to discuss the proposal with you , and . determine your interest in participating . . I look forward to speaking with you , and potentially working with you as a . participant in this project . . > . Thank You . Bob Young . - Benchmark_Sales_Presentation_v2 . ppt

SBX 27 ( Bowen ) , regarding direct access , failed passage on the Senate floor . on a vote of 23 - 11 ( the bill has an urgency clause and requires 27 votes ) . . Senator Peace was the only Democrat to vote against the bill . Senator Peace . spoke against the bill for five minutes during which time he , in a very . emotional state , blamed Enron for the energy crisis , claimed Enron's version . of direct access means only small customers pay for lines and other similar . charges , is trying to ruin the Japanese energy market , is running the . proceedings in Washington where it has already admitted its guilt , and is . looking for another opportunity to steal from California consumers . Two . Republicans spoke against the bill but their comments more or less focused . on DWR's contracts . One Republican tried to insert a hostile amendment in . the bill to establish a version of the windfall profits tax on municipal . utilities . The amendment failed passage on a party - line vote with the . exception of a vote in support from Senator Peace . . In her close , Senator Bowen indicated that the viability of direct access . would be tied to amount of power purchased by DWR . She characterized DWR's . contracts as outrageous , but expected , given that they were purchased in . duress out of sheer necessity . Senator Bowen did request reconsideration of . the measure .

Hello all , . ? . I made a reservation ? at Cleone Gardens Inn , just across the street from the . ranch . ? I reserved a room for Pat , Cal and myself , but was unsure what other . reservations to make for the rest of the group because some of you are still . tentative and I'm not sure who is bringing SOs / dates . ? . ? . The inn has one room called the Blue Iris room with two double beds that . might work for Jeff W . and Jeff D . if going up single ; most of their other . rooms have a queen or king bed ( the Meadow View king room sounded nice for a . couple if we have any going up ) . ? Both of those are still ? available for the . weekend we are planning to be there . ? ? I think there may be some cottages . available also for multiple people , but I'm not sure what the configurations . of those are . ? A full breakfast can be ordered from some of the rooms for . $ 14 . 00 extra . ? They serve breakfast at 8 : 00 a . m . ? Pat , Cal and I have a . suite with a small kitchen , so we may also be able to host some minimal . meals / snacks / drinks . ? . ? . The phone number of Cleone Gardens is 1 - 800 - 400 - 2189 . ?

Yesterday the PUC defeated ( 3 - 2 ) on a party line vote the proposed decision . of Commissioner Bilas re interim policy on standby charges . ? Instead , the . Commission approved Commissioner Wood's alternate , which several parties . ( State Consumers , ORA , New Energy , Capstone , et al ) had protested . ? My . understanding is that Commr . Wood's alternate was approved with no changes . ? . It agreed with utilities that standby charges should not reflect diversity . benefits of DG in distribution because none currently exist . . This decision may have negative implications for the sharing of grid benefits . of DG with end use consumers and other distributed generators who may provide . them . . Best , . Jay Morse , ORA
This is troubling but not devastating . ? I think we need to go back to the . Leg and get an intent letter so that as the PUC moves forward with . implementing 28X they remember that it supercedes the ? 99 - 10 - 025 . ? Then we . need to come together as an industry and lobby hard . . ? . Steven ? . - -

PG & E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently . Prior to . June they appeared to be using a market based price for power , but in June . the credit dropped to about $ 40 / MWh which looks like utility - owned gen . . We want to make sure we are not missing a utility - levied charge in our . forward curves ( e . g . CTC charge that will be applied to DA ) so we're trying . to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits . . I talked to the PG & E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group . has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is . calculated . Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon . as possible ? Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want . to discover there's a charge we don't know about . . Thanks , . Tamara .

Hi Chris ! . I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November . regarding your missing cheque . I wish I had better news for the holiday . season . .

Dear John : . You're opening my flood gates , and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely . upset . . Please read the attached letter , which is the one that we sent to Dunn last . week . To wit : according to the ISO's own calculations , Enron represents . FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT - - that's four - tenths of one percentof the . alleged """" overcharges . """" John , combined , the government sellers , including CA . munis have , by the ISOs own calculations , """" overcharged """" California by a . factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have """" overcharged . """" . ( See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose . ) . So notes like this , are ill - informed . I'm looking forward to Mr . Marcus and . others directing their invective at SMUD , Glendale , Pasadena , Burbank and . LADWP . Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying , """" well , it's not the . gouging . that's not the problem . it's the """" profit motive """" we've set up . that's the problem . """" so munis are victims of a disease ( profits ) they can't . control . everyone else is blood - sucking scum . ( in addition , please inform . Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to . others . it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra , but . getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR . contract problem . ) . Sorry for the flame , but it's gotten extremely tiresome , and it ain't . personal ; but the emperor has no clothes , which will increasingly become . increasingly apparent . . all that aside , we've got other work that's more important , and i look . forward to continue working on it . . best , . jeff .

As I alluded to in my note yesterday , Enron has received a commitment for $ 1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks . This is great news , more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need . You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity , now that we have the debt in place , but the equity we be a longer process . . In the meantime , lets get back to work . I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel """" angst """" . . Rick

Maragaret , . I have 2 prepays in this email . We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8 : 40 AM tomorrow . . Note to all . The first prepay is to TXU . I'm requesting $ 22 , 500 . 00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal . . The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee . If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant , we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal . This is what we did on the 2nd - 6th . I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th . . My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers ( with prepays ) on the East Coast , TXU and Reliant . I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier ( maybe Coral ) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA . Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent . However , last Thursday , Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes . So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier . We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up .

Hi Nik . This is the nasty side of American business . There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about . These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either . People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood . But hang in there , opportunities are fewer , but they are out there . You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare . . Enron is one heck of a story . What a ride ! The only conclusion I have is , next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets , I am going to smack him bad . As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble , it is not easy to manage businesses which are over - valued either . There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves , while it might be the investors folly and nothing more . I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn . . I will look out for opportunities out here . Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent . You keep at it bud , and things are going to get better . This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out . Say hi to Cindy and Noah . . Harry . - -

Hi Chris . 1 . We don't have a """" one off form """" for US power trading , but it may be possible to use the US GTCs ( 3 pages ) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI . It however does not define INTO products , and in general EEI is much better and longer . Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions . . 2 . Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs . physical debate . ( ps you may think the pain is over but . . . in the US , meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products . oh boy ) . . Hope all is good and Addy is doing well . Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood . See ya all soon I hope . . - -

The Texas RailRoad Commission ( TRC ) has sent a guideline for cleanup of . condensate spills to its District Offices for implementation on July 1 , . 2000 . Attached is the guideline which is titled , . Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater . Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident ( Statewide Rules 8 , 20 , . and 91 ) . The introduction to the guideline states that it establishes bench marks and . protocols that , when met and followed , will demonstrate that condensate . spills have been addressed in a manner that complies with Statewide Rules 8 , . 20 , and 91 . . Some comments related to this guideline from an industry association meeting . in mid - July are listed below : . There appeared to be a wide variation in response of the districts to this . guideline . . The TRC is receiving landowner compliants . The TRC has gone out and found . spills not cleaned up , where closure reports have been submitted . . Parts of the guideline are not clear and the groundwater classification is . not consistent with TRRP . A revised guideline might be issued by TRC . . This condensate guideline is temporary until RBCA guidelines are available . . TRC is working on a software model projected by the end of this year . . Also attached is another guideline that the TRC issued at the same time , . which is titled : . Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non - sensitive . Areas ( Statewide Rules 8 , 20 , and 91 ) . . In a somewhat related item , the General Land Office on June 23 , 2000 issued . revised penalty guidelines ( attached ) effective August 1st for oil spills in . Texas coastal waters . Spills of less than a gallon will have fines of $ 250 . . The fines for larger spills will depend on factors such as the size of the . spills , the number of unauthorized discharges in the past twelve - month . period , and whether a Sound Management Practice or like program is in place .

04 : 33 20Nov2001 RSF - Platt's : Enron sees cash drain , warns on survival . New York ( Platts ) - - 20Nov2001 / 533 am EST / 1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday , revealing a huge cash drain , despite last week's $ 1 . 5 - bil asset - backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy . Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $ 1 . 2 - bil , even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier , $ 550 - mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $ 3 - bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $ 1 . 9 - bil of commercial paper . Enron blamed operating costs , trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners . Enron said it expects $ 800 - mil soon from asset sales and got another $ 440 - mil bank line Monday . But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment - grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due . That could have a """" material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern , """" it warned . . For Related News , Double Click on one of these codes : .

This . approval also includes stump removal if need be . . . . . .

The question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm . capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a ROFR . . I've done some checking , and the answer is no , a negotiated rate shipper that . entered into a contract after March 27 , 2000 does not automatically get ROFR . rights . This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No . 637 - A . It does not . matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate ; the . contract is still not considered to be """" at maximum rates """" for ROFR purposes . . As you know , our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR . rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR . rights . . Any questions - - let me know .

Jim and Cody , . I think it is a good idea to proceed with soliciting bids for the . installation of the new floating roof for the Concho tank . However , approval . to spend capital dollars only comes in the form of final approval of the . AFE . Since this will be an unbudgeted AFE , some economic justification will . be required with the AFE request . Also , I am sure that you are aware of the . landowner notice and air permit requirements that must be met before . construction begins . My advice is to avoid making expenditures or . commitments until the AFE is approved . With good economic justification , we . should be able to have the AFE approved before you get all the bids back . . Rick and Mark , please make sure that Cody has a good set of specs for his bid . package . . Cutty . Jim Coen . 07 / 13 / 00 11 : 39 AM

Stan , . I plan to participate on tomorrow's conference call on your behalf . . I met with Rae earlier today and had a quick preview of this document . The . crux of the recommendation is that Rae would like to take a procedural vote . at the March 2 Board meeting on whether the Board intends to move forward . with pursuing retail standards . . If the procedural vote is """" yes , """" then she is proposing to have Jay Costan and . Bill Boswell start drafting the governance documents . I mentioned that I . would like to participate in reviewing the Bylaws and Certificate as your . representative . . I think that the attached backround and Feb . 14 meeting summary is fine . I . have lots of thoughts on the possible organizational structure document - - . but these are probably best saved until the Board votes on its intentions . . I'd say the procedural vote is too close to call at this point .

We're in the process of working with market participants ( i . e . , ESPs , large customer groups , etc . ) to figure this out . There are many thorny legal issues that need to be worked out and many regulatory lawyers are combing over the implications , options , etc . Our goal is to come up with a solution that : . 1 ) meets the Commission's objectives of administering the DA suspension date of 9 . 20 . 01 . . 2 ) gives the Commission the information it needs to administer the suspension without requiring customers to submit specific contract language ( which the Commission doesn't need to administer the suspension ) . 3 ) gives customers full flexibility to use contract provisions entered into with ESPs . 4 ) fully protects confidential commercial information contained in the contracts . In general , there appears to be considerable reluctance on the part of the industry to submit contracts to the California Commission , which doesn't regulate either counterparty . . In short , the issues are tough and complex . We're meeting first thing with groups next week , and presumably , we can get back to our customers soon thereafter with more info . . Mike Smith likely has additional insights from the legal perspective . . If there are any other questions , let us know . . Best , . Jeff . - -

As a follow up to our meeting last week with Colleen on the Ardmore facility , I had a conversation this morningwith Richard Sanders concerning the status of the settlement negotiations with Dynegy concerning Northern Natural Gas . I understand from Richard that part of the settlement will be an agreement that will allow Enron Corp to continue to lease the Ardmore facility as a data center . . I just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow Enron to provide space to NETCO for its hardware during a transition period until NETCO can relocate its hardware to a new data center . The lease also needs to make it clear that access to the Ardmore facility needs to be under Enron's control . . Similarily the software license that Enron will retain covering all the Enron developed software will also need to provide that Enron can use the covered software to provide services to third parties such as AEP , Bridgeline and Northern Natural Gas . If anyone has any questions , please give me a call . . Anne C . Koehler . Sr . Counsel . Enron Wholesale Services . 1400 Smith Street , EB3839 . Houston , Texas 77002 .

In response to the FERC Order on the California marketplace , Ridgeway Power . filed comments argueing for a waiver of QF regulations in order to incent . more power into the California marketplace . IEP discussed this concept with . FERC Commissioners today and the Commission issued late today an Order . Granting Emergency Waiver of QF Regulations for the remainder of this year . . This order is attached as part of an additional order by FERC granting the . CAISO request for implementation of a $ 250 """" soft cap """" plus penalities for . failue to respond to CAISO dispatch orders during an emergency . . For QFs positioned to take advantage of the FERC Order , IEP suggests ( 1 ) . procure legal advice because in essense you have an existing contract with . the utility , ( 2 ) contact your utility / contract holder , and as appropriate . move to implement the FERC Order . Your existing bilateral contract with the . utility provides for a SRAC based payment mechanism which appears to apply . under the FERC Order . Note , however , that the waiver at this time only . applies through the end of this year . You may have other options as well . . - -

Janet - . 1 . The best split is probably just 50 / 50 on personnel . While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart , many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles . The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward ( for example , if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter ) . . 2 . In terms of approving outside service expenditures , I would like to sit down with you , Louise , and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals . I will try and set up some time the first week of December . . 4 . I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box . This will increase the budget by $ 400k ( based on historical figures ) . I have attached a new org chart to represent this change . . Also , Dan Staines ( who is not on the Org Chart ) has an Employment contract that ends 6 / 12 / 2002 . Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction . We can sever him , but his contract will need to be paid off ( $ 87k ) . Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor ( ex - Southern exec ) to support our SE activities . I am trying to get a copy of the contract , but I think that it is in place until 8 / 02 . My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today . .

Texas A & M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours . . One of the players , while on the way to the locker room happened to look . down and notice a suspicious looking , unknown powdery substance on the . practice field . Head coach R . C . Slocum immediately suspended practice while . the FBI was called in to investigate . After a complete field analysis , the . FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually . the goal line . Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team . was not likely to encounter the substance again . . Ha ! Ha !

Mostly a social call . Brief discussion on noise in the market he's hearing and reading , etc . He walked me through oustanding issues on alamac that he is working with duran and heather to resolve . Heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so I'll followup on those . I suggested rather than buying assets from us ( alamac ) , he should be ready for us to ask him to co - invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions ( bny , cogentrix , uae , etc - didn't discuss any particular deals ) . Told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly . He's ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him . I can fill you in on more details later . Budget allocation from glisan has been postponed . I will let you know the outcome when its resolved . . - - . Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld ( www . BlackBerry . net )

The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA ( Transportation Agreement ) 97ZH . Citizens purchased 23 , 175 MMBtu to apply to this imbalance . For the May invoice , we need to subtract this amount from usage . Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others to the citygate . This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport this gas in ourselves . . After this trade , the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30 , 688 MMBtu . ENA is responsible for this imbalance . It is my understanding that future imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA . Therefore , this current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated . . Call me with any questions . . Chris

Thanks for dinner last night - I enjoyed talking with you and meeting . Eric . . . . . Here is the poem you requested . . Paranoid . Do you really care what I have to say ? . Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway ? . Should I sit here like a statue in stone ? . Do I really like feeling so alone ? . What did I do to the world to feel this way ? . Why am I so paranoid everyday ? . My mind lives in a constant shade of black . I always want to run and pack . To find a world that's all my own . Somewhere I can finally call home . But the fear remains with me . It's all I can see . Why does everybody stare ? . Or even glare . They say it's all in my head . It's like I'm a ghost back from the dead . It's scary to be left alone . Even inside my own home . Everyone's out to get me . All after me . Now when you ask me what's wrong ? . It takes me too long . To figure out . What the questions about . Do you really care what I have to say ? . Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway ? . Should I sit here like a statue in stone ? . Do I really like feeling so alone ? . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ MICHELLE MCVICKER 12 / 20 / 01 ~ ~ ~

I am copying Sara on this b / c I would be interested in her input if she has a . different take than I do . . I understand your message to mean that P & G is offering a representation from . them that they will strictly adhere to their corporate derivatives policy . ( with a copy of the policy attached to the contract ) , and , in exchange for . this , they would like the """" No Reliance """" representation deleted entirely . . I don't really see how such a representation helps us with the """" No Reliance """" . problem . The CFTC has ruled that in a dealer / customer context , if the . customer relies on the dealer's expertise in entering into a trade , then the . trade may be unenforceable against the customer . The legal principle is one . of fiduciary duty and doesn't really have anything to do with corporate . authorization . In other words , the fact that the trade is authorized does . not change the fact that the customer is relying on the dealer's superior . knowledge . . In its 1996 lawsuit with Bankers Trust , Procter & Gamble unwound an interest . rate swap position when they ended up about $ 200 million out of the money . . P & G argued that they were relying on BT due to BT's superior expertise in . interest rate markets , and therefore P & G shouldn't have to pay . The issue of . whether or not P & G was authorized to enter into the swaps was not an issue at . all in that case , nor would it be an issue , in my opinion , if P & G sought to . unwind a pulp and paper swap with us based on our alleged superior expertise . in pulp and paper markets . . The danger of having positions unwound has made the """" No Reliance """" clause one . of the most important clauses in the ISDA for us . I will look at and . consider any particular language they may wish to propose , but conceptually , . we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise . in deciding whether to enter into a trade . - - Bob .

Just remember that we allowed . makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20th for a total volume of 5K over 3 days so that . will apply toward the 4th and part of the 9th .

Louise , . Unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to meet this past Wednesday . Marathon will not give Enron the opportunity to commercially manage Marathon Ashland's ( MAP ) assets which represents their refined products and crude divisions . Unfortunately for us , at this time , MAP has done very well these past two years ( intrinsic position of short crude and long refined products ) to warrant being the """" crown jewel """" of Marathon . However , they still want to pursue the """" hydrocarbon desk """" for all of their Global Upstream business . However , they have promised , based on the expected success from the business venture from Enron , to approach the MAP board . Also , Marathon has assigned a second individual ( David Risser ) to work on joint opportunities between Enron and Marathon . . As such , I have met with the appropriate representatives from Power , Natural Gas and LNG to put together a document clarifying our need to identify relevant data across these commodities . I have attached this data request and would appreciate your blessing of the document . . I want to send out this document , via email , to Marathon late tomorrow morning . . Regards , Mrha

Tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional Big . Cowboy production is coming from . Apparently , HPL cut a deal to purchase . this gas at """" HPL meters """" at Rocher and Big Cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been . pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . All along , these volumes . have been flowing into the GEPL / Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch . Tom . and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and . determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place , as IM . Wellhead , to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant . . We unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the HPL purchase to the TU . tickets and moved the gas on our transport on GEPL to the plant , effective . April 1 . This resolves our overproduction issues for April and forward . . Please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or . information to add . . Mary

I am going to propose to him that all of Crescendo goes into ECR and he reimburses Upstream Products for incurred capital charges for 2001 .

Just talked to Noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared . They want to do a 20 year , fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price . All other gas outside the 10 % swing will be priced at Gas Daily + / - $ . 05 . We are adding a $ . 25 premium on the 10 % swing and the baseload is approximately 1000 / day . If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal , they would like to see what those are - that might sway them . . Jay , I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal . And they have asked me for this credit information twice today . It's all about you ! ! . Thanks a million for your help ! . Kim
My apologies . I took a vacation that I was in much need of , and as you know , . it's more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the . day - to - day mess .

That said , I also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the . conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to . make leaving a compelling proposition . Of course , it goes without saying . that working with you is about as compelling as it gets , but when I stack up . the other pieces of the puzzle , they seem somewhat less compelling than the . opportunity to work with you . It is so enticing . But it is with extreme . regret that I am inclined to decline your gracious offer . . Would be happy to discuss it further , and you know without me saying that I . am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative . Give a holler . when you find a minute . . Best , . Jeff

The only exception to this rule should be a . temporary exception for you and Mike to call in , with other exceptions to be . made as hot issues arise . . Angie will see what she can do about arranging a videoconference but does not . make any promises , as any type of conference room is difficult to find these . days . . Minutes would be great .

Hey Joe - . I will send the answers to your Mom directly , but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b / c I was in the associate program . As you know , we rotate every six months . The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged , we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place ( just kidding ) . Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas . . Beth . - -

With Ken Lay's resignation , you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company . The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild . . First , the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process . This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business . . The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer . Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper , a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations . . Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy . . As you know , Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo , Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization . In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS , Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg . We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward . . In addition to engaging Steve , Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive . I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer , and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer . . We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined . . Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday . The ongoing uncertainty about our future , coupled with the constant media scrutiny , makes this situation difficult for all of us . While no one can control the media , we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead . And in doing so , we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees . .

I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party . You are the chosen few . The cruise is set for Sat . Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport . Transportation will be arranged for you . We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th . I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e - mail . The final tally will be $ 32 a person . I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling . Sadly , the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner . . Let me know if you have any questions . . - Eric

Hi Jon , . Thinking of you and thought I'd try out your new e - mail address . Hope you are having a good day . It snowed again last night , but is suppose to warm up a bit today . Dad got home late last night from Vancouver . He said it was very nice there . . I forgot to tell you and Beth last time we talked that the pointsettia you gave Dad when he was in hospital at Christmas is still doing well , The other ones I had are long gone . Just thought you should know that it probably pays to spend the buck on them as it must mean they are better cared for during growth . Also , did you ever call Grandpa and what did he have to say ? I talked to him briefly last night but didn't want to ask if you had talked to him in case you hadn't . He asked about you though and was of course pleased to hear you were working . He has a very sore throat so I didn't talk very long . . Okay I don't want to take up too much of your time . Love you . . Mum

Hi Jon , . Enron currently markets about 4 . 5bcf of NIT per day but there is no real way of measuring total NIT's taking place in the market place each day . . I have been told that although the total gas produced in Alberta is over 12bcf a day that the NIT number can easily be double this . It doesn't appear that Enron markets 50 % of Alberta's gas each day . . . yet . . I hope this answers your question , let me know if you need anything else . . Ian . - -

Hi Jonathan , . Here is the address to send the cheque : . RBC Dominion Securities . # 1100 - 1708 Dolphin Avenue . Kelowna , BC V1Y 9S4 . Just so you know our firm charges a administration / trustee fee for Registered accounts each year as do all full service brokerage firms ( Nesbitt / Wood Gundy etc ) . It is for the work involved in reporting the accounts to Revenue Canada . For accounts holding only bonds , mutual funds and trust units the fee is $ 45 dollars plus taxes . For accounts such as yours holding the above plus stock positions the fee is $ 125 dollars plus taxes each year . . We can rebalance your account to take positions in only mutual funds and trust units but you are not allowed to add any money to the account to buy new positions . . Only Credit Unions and Banks provide fee free RSP accounts and those usually do not include stock positions . I guess it is your decision on how you would like to proceed with this account . If you want to check other firms to see if they would hold the RSP account for no fee you can certainly do that but if you decide to stay with RBC Dominion Securities they will charge you each year . Sorry for the bad news . Of course if your account goes up even 5 % per year you would have a gain of $ 2500 dollars and a $ 125 dollar fee would be a small part of that gain . We could sell $ 600 dollars worth of something in the account to generate cash for the fees for 4 years if you would like , That would get you some time to see if you remain in the US . . Let me know how you would like to proceed . . Dale Onrait , BSP MBA . RBC Investments - Kelowna . 1 - 800 - 756 - 2211 or ( 250 ) 712 - 2191

Kim gave this e - mail address to Debbie who forwarded it to me . Just checking in to let you know you and your family are in our thoughts and prayers . We are happy you have arrived - things must be going fairly smoothly . I'm thinking that its a good thing that you got all of the negative experiences out of the way before your trip . Everything can go well from now on . I'm sure Kim and Chad will be glad when their ladies return from their adventure and things can get back to just the usual crises . Rob , Steve , Blair , Christi , and Zelda all send their prayers and best wishes - I'm assuming Debbie will send you an e - mail also ( she is off today ) .

FYI . It sounds like the developer with whom we are negotiating on the MHI turbines will not be paying us the initial payment today . We have communicated to him that we will not hold the turbines off the market until he makes a cash payments and we will continue to work with other potential purchasers .

I am going to concurrently move forward on a similar basis with this company and see which one gets there first . Let me know if anyone wants to approach this differently . . Thanks , . Brett . -

Michelle / Kimberly , I was looking at the economics for Park - N - Rides ( on the TW Mainline Leg ) thought you might be interested in this : . According to Gary Choquette , it costs us in fuel 1420 Mscf / d for storage of 42 , 502 Mscf of gas . Assuming a BTU factor of 1 . 00 and at a gas cost of $ 3 . 00 per MMBTU - - fuel costs amount to $ 4260 / day . Adding O & M to this ( assuming 1 / 3 fuel cost ) , the total cost of this storage to us is ~ 13 cents . . Kim Kouri

Easter is good for us .
Ed , . We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed . because the revised 11 . 2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as . of the date hereof , which is not within the reasonable control of the party . and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome . or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof , all . without listing specific types of events which might be considered . . You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for . economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the . preceding sentence . By example , assuming that more than one transporter . could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point , if the . transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure , the . Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining . transportation on another transporter , irrespective of the cost . . I trust that this answers your questions . If not , please feel free to call . me at ( 713 ) 853 - 6895 . . Jared Kaiser . 10 / 24 / 2000 08 : 42 AM

Jim talked to me about his resignation again on Friday . He indicated that he . wished for his replacement to be chosen before he resigns . I think he really . thought he is helping the board by doing it this way . I told him that I did . not believe that it was appropriate to """" arrange """" things . I also told him that . he can remain on the board for as long as he lives in his unit . And the board . will replace him by seeking the best person to fill his seat for the . remainder of his term when he resigns . He indicated that in the past the next . person getting the highest number of votes would be selected . I informed him . that while this had happened in the past , but the board is not obligated to . do it in this manner . . We should ask anyone who is interested to fill this seat to submit his / her . name to be considered by the board . . Houshyar

Michelle , . We may reap the most benefit by having all the site HR Managers , Site Safety . Supervisors / Nurse Practitioners , Mike Indivero , Tony Bolar Softich ( Safety ) , . Steve Olenik ( Safety ) , Sean Mayer ( Construction ) , Frank Petty ( Director of . Construction ) , Mike Ranz ( VP Construction ) , Bob Black ( Manager Of Projects ) , . maybe a few other home office construction managers selected by Mike Ranz or . Frank Petty in attendance . I think you and Rick need to chair the meeting . because you will lend credibility and importance to the issue . You may even . want to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss ( or his designee ) to sit in to . emphasize the importance of this issue . Too often I hear """" Enron has plenty . of money """" and """" Thats why we have lawyers """" - the truth being we are the . guardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility . to protect those assets for the health and well being of the company , the . stockholders and the employees of Enron Corp . My experience has been that we . do a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR , Safety and . Construction get together and meet on anything . Liability / Settlement checks . regardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of . the employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions . effecting employment offers . In the end if supervisors or managers fail to . act prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a . penalty . The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of . the companies money by making reckless decisions . Thats the approach I would . take with these people . The Weigle case does not need to be looked at like . it only cost us $ 490 . 00 . This continued reckless disregard we have in our . decision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we will . replace Foster Wheeler's Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement as . something the EPC Industry talks about . I may be overreacting here but I've . been in the middle of Nepco's harassment , discrimination other issues for . the last 18 months . Call me if you have any questions . Thanks for asking . . Mie

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building , Enron Center South . . Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday . In the ensuing six weeks another 1 , 500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets , Enron Net Works , and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow , occupying levels 4 , 5 , and 6 . . We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space . HOWEVER , since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors , including limited access corridors from the skywalk , we ask that : . ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING . . Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors . In addition , the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas . . We are planning an open house in late Nov . or early Dec . so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment . Thank you for your cooperation . . Office of the Chairman

Veronica , . The credit language is only one of many areas of disagreement between the . consultants view of what the contract should look like and our version . . Their last response was that the MAC would be triggered if Enron Corp . fell . below an A rating . I informed them that we could not agree because it was my . understanding that Enron Corp . was currently rated as BBB . I will let you . know if you need to be involved in the contract negotiation or . non - negotiation in the future . I do not currently have a response from the . consultant as to our last position on her nonagreement to make the necessary . changes so that we could agree to document the 3month deal . .

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage . I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations . On October 1 , we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated . Will look into it again tomorrow . . 402 is nearly complete . Ran into an error while running a test day , and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow . 405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly . . I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23 , and should be able to wrap up most , if not all , of the rest tomorrow . . If we can get them working properly tomorrow , then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday , and the Finals on Monday . . Caroline . - -

We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ . Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes , then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done . . Once all four are done and transferred , then we can do the Total 407 part , which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA . The code hasn't been fully tested yet , so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday . . I am finished with September Finals for the non - deviation stuff through the 28th , and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning . . I anticipate having all of September completely actualized ( for both Preliminary and Final ) by cob Tuesday . . C . -

TCPL and the Stakeholders have been meeting regularly since January and are . close to a partial two year toll settlement along the following lines . acceptable to TCPL : . Cost of Capital and ROE - to be litigated in NEB Rate Hearing . Operations , Maintenance and Administration Costs - 2001 = $ 223M 2002 = . $ 216 . 5M . Depreciation - 2001 2 . 76 % ( increase of 0 . 1 % ) 2002 = 2 . 91 % ( approx $ 60M . over two years ) . Authorized Overrun Service of 2 . 5 % of FT credited to IT services . Employee Severance costs amortized over 3 years . Revenue Sharing to be capped at $ 5M . New Services to be tariffed and run through expedited Tolls Task Force . Process . If opposed at TTF , sponsors can file application with NEB . . IT Floor = greater of 80 % of FT toll or sum of incremental marginal fuel cost . pus FT Commodity toll plus 5 % of daily FT demand toll . STFT - status quo . AECO / ANR Storage - TCPL commitment to review monetization and disposition . options on 8 bcf this year . In terms of an Eastern Zone toll and prior to taking into account any . increase for higher cost of capital , this represents about CDN $ 1 . 10 / GJ in . 2001 and $ 1 . 15 in 2002 ( assuming discretionary revenue of $ 40M / year ) . . Going around the table most stakeholders , including the LDCs and CAPP gave it . unenthusiastic support although IGUA and Centra Man indicated they have . strong problems with AOS if it is run as a credit to IT services . El Paso . and PGE were non - commital and may end up opposed . Representing Enron , I . expressed concern about the lack of clarity around what marginal fuel costs . mean but indicated we would unlikely to be opposed ( i . e prepared to litigate ) . if it was otherwise widely supported . . TCPL is to draft agreement language for distribution next week . . Any questions let me know . . Kevin . 403 974 - 6727

Each of these commodities required significant time spent learning about the new commodity , training with the groups that handle these commodities , and learning a new P & L reporting format for each new commodity . Kori did an excellent job of building on her previous experiences and integrating that knowledge with the new skillsets to meet the increasing demands of her high profile internal customer , who trusts her completely . .

During 2001 Laura was asked to increase her work from just standard , manual deal entry , to running our automated deal upload system and is a key contact for training others on it , as well as a contact when I .

In addition , Laura has become a backup for our brokered deal confirmation position , and she has developed reliable contacts at the brokerage houses we deal with .

The TDS IT group needs your approval to start work on some enhancements to the TDS Deal Ticker . . TDS currently is not valuing physical changed deals correctly . . Change deal valuation is based on current value vs the value from the previous night port calc . However since CPR numbers can change . when the deal is revised , it does not have a exact previous valuation to compare to . Resulting in full deal value displaying as the change . . Bill has a concept to base Change Deal Value on the whole Sitara deal rather than the individual CPR tickets . . TDS does not value correctly deals priced to the desk at Mid . Current valuation does not take physical premium into effect . Not a large value effect unless the physical premium is large , . such as IF - NGPL / Harper , that has a premium of $ . 22 . . The CPR reader can be changed to include the Mid Market Flag that CPR has . Valuation can then include premium into the calc .

All . Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation , which I'll be . presenting at a Real Options Group conference in Cambridge next month . . I've removed the gas storage pricing example , and instead put in a simple . example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches ( should . one wish to do so ) . This is a response to the heavily decision - tree . dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at . I . want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and . option pricing as special cases , the synthesis needed for correct real option . valuation . . My presentation now covers : . 1 . Decision trees . . 2 . Binomial option pricing trees . . 3 . Power station valuation . . 4 . Power asset development . . The option pricing and power examples are based on the ( too simplistic ) . binomial tree method . I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most . correct way to do this . . Steve

Announcement for E283 - 1 : Real Estate Finance : . Dear all : . Let me introduce myself . I am your TA , Barbara Bukhvalova . During this semester you will not see much of me unless you come to my office hours . However , you will be able to read my comments on some of your graded work and will receive occasional messages from me through Izio . . I have TAed this corse before and unlike last semester I am very proud that I have conquered the skill of using finance calculators which is a very hard task for absent minded PhD students . I hold regular office hours which hopefully will fit most , but if for some reason you need alternative arrangements do not hesitate to ask me for an appointment or / and please do communicate with me via email about shorter questions you might have . . I am going to post a math primer momentarily . This document is for ( very ) optional perusal . It is targeting those of you who had a long break in studies before joining Haas and / or generally are not very friendly with math . The criterion of usefulness of that file is how well you follow the lecture on mortgage math ( duration , convexity etc . ) . If you feel like you are lacking some basic intuition on where the formulas are coming from , you can have a glance at this short ( barely 3 - page ) document . Otherwise you might not benefit from looking at it at all . . I am looking forward to the rest of the semester and wish you all good luck . . Barbara . = .

Based on information received at 4 pm this afternoon from Comm . Brown , the . CPUC is reportedly set to suspend direct access tomorrow with an effective . date of Sept . 20 for the suspension . There has been a huge drop in state . tax revenues this week as a result of economic inactivity due to the . terrotist attacks , and this appears to have reinvigorated the need to issue . bonds - - if they can be sold .

Just so you know , I am nearer the bottom of the issue . . A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment . So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here , to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW . None of them did , including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment . . Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment . Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels . So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting . . As there is no way around ibuyit , I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment . . As no - one replied to my previous email - I live in hope . . Thanks . Louise . - -
We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20 , 2001 . . This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc . and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6 / 16 / 95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot . .

I was just thinking about the anniversary thing , too . I bought a book at . Barnes & Noble - - 100 Best Family Resorts in North America . I found the name . of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought . looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina . Another . place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee . Both . meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina / Tennessee range . I will get . info on both and we can look at it . I worry a little bit about having such a . range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is . plenty to do for all - - just sitting for some , shopping , eating , golf , etc . . These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough . variety . I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that . may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the . whole family . One of those might catch their interest as well . . I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the . thought of this trip could wear thin . I would like the opportunity to be . together with everyone - - maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the . two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night ! Even though Dad is . doing so much better , you never know when you will have the chance to get . everyone together on a trip like this . Memory - maker or nightmare - - could be . a toss up , but maybe worth the try . Let's share some research and see if . there is any place that we could get excited about going . .

Executive Summary . AvailDocument is the deliverable given to Erik Ellis to support Business . Development turbine sales efforts . I send it you to expedite coordination . between analysts and the Controller Group . Garth Ripton asked for feedback . on an earlier draft of this table and Eric Ellis asked for it to be updated . on how existing counters worked and reviewed for how counters should work . . The document AvailDocumentcolor retains the same green and red coding . initiated by Garth in the earlier draft . The yellow coloring indicated . changes or comments added by Mark Walker . Paul Landers and Kim Nguyen were . very helpful in gathering data on the existing result of faults and errors . and I coordinated with two Field Crews to ensure that the counters were . compatible with Field Ops requirements . . One important result is that several counters cause the maintenance time . counter to be incremented even though they also would be used for repairs . . If the rotary switch on the controller panel is religiously set to """" maint """" or . """" repair """" before all maintenances or repairs then there will not be any . excessively large number of maintenance hours . Field Operations will request . further emphasis on using the rotary switch to ensure that availabilities are . correct .

Sheryl : I think I mentioned to those on the call that the Dec 27 call would . be a placeholder for a meeting just in case we need to have a discussion . regarding the PGE plan , FERC developments or the PX plan , all of which will . probably have developments over the next few days . Noone , including me , . wants to spend any more time than is necessary in meetings , at this time of . the year or any other time . Therefore , I propose to leave the scheduled . call for 12 / 27 in place for the moment , with the hope that we can cancel it . or limit it to a short call . I am pleased to note that our calls have . gotten shorter , and we have scheduled separate calls from time to time to . discuss individual topics when necessary . . I too want the subcommittees to address the more detailed issues and to . bring issues to the full committee as appropriate . In many instances , this . is what is happening . However , as you know , the members of the full . committee often want to discuss topics in detail and I try to give everyone . an opportunity to voice their views , while at the same time trying to move . things along . I am sure that everyone is busy and brings up items to . discuss during the committee meetings only when they think they are . important enough to take up the time of the full committee . We all owe that . to each other . . At our next meeting , I will propose to schedule the regular calls two weeks . apart , with the understanding that we can schedule more frequent meetings . when necessary . Thanks for the suggestion . . - winmail . dat

His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed , as . will his leadership on the gas team . Although Steve's official last day with . the company is in two weeks , today is his last day in the office . He will be . available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you . may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve . Patti has his . home number if you need that . We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and . we will let you know when and where that will take place . . Effective tomorrow , Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk . group , reporting to me .

by now you should all have by fax the dismissals filed today in the schultes case , including the gift to us of a dismissal of the contract counts ( 1 - 4 ) against the enron entities as well ! i spoke with counsel for sdi , who - despite confidentiality restrictions - confirmed my instinct that the defendants were concerned that they could be brought back in if the contract claims still existed against us . i have to think harder as to whether they're really off the hook on the tort counts , but it's at least reassuring they thought so . . interesting as well , the defendants apparently urged the plaintiff to just dismiss us . his lawyer apparently rejected the suggestion with the explanation that we could pay too . they responded """" for what """" ? and apparently the plaintiff's counsel just repeated the same response . if it offers any comfort , sdi's lawyer can't imagine any case schultes has to proceed against us on . . i asked why we hadn't been broached to join in , and the only explanation i got - which didn't seem really to be enough of an answer - was that this was just part of a bigger settlement of the securities cases . for our info , have there been such settlements ? . the """" big """" strategic question now is do we just wait to hear from the court or plaintiff's counsel , or do we push for a hearing . thoughts ? .

Hello Team , . The FOEX US pix paper index for newsprint is down $ 6 . 22 from $ 530 . 87 last week to $ 524 . 65 this week . The decline continues . . . . PPPC released its September Flash report for newsprint . Please find the Flash report notes below and the September numbers attached in the file below : . Production at North American mills was 15 . 6 % lower than in September of last year , resulting in an 82 % operating rate . If we exclude the 130 , 000 tonnes of idled capacity at the Steilacoom WA mill , the North American operating rate would be 83 % . . Total North American newsprint shipments were down 15 . 4 % year - over - year in September , largely the result of North American demand falling off by 15 % . This drop in demand can be explained in part by consumers reducing their stock levels in September 2001 . This explains why consumption figures registered a lower year - over - year decrease for the current month . . Shipments to overseas markets also suffered a decline , dropping almost 17 % compared to the same month last year , as North American deliveries to Western Europe fell 41 % . . At the end of September , North American mills saw their inventories decrease by 28 , 000 tonnes from the preceding month to 477 , 000 tonnes , and therefore back below their historical average . . US dailies consumed 9 . 1 % less newsprint than in September 2000 , and total consumption in the US was down 9 % . Many publishers reported a substantial increase in newsprint usage to cover the September 11th tragedy ( additional sections , increased single - copy sales ) , especially in the week that immediately followed it . However , the increase in consumption seems in effect to have been offset by the wave of advertising cancellations in the aftermath of the attack . At the end of the month , US dailies stock levels were 84 , 000 tonnes lower than the preceding month . Thus US dailies stocks fell from 43 days of supply at the end of August to 38 days of supply at the end September . . Ayesha

I just spoke with Cheryl Harding about getting the proposed contract for . compensation credits . The NCL credits are for habitat disturbance only not . incidental take . KWB credits which include both are $ 2000 . 00 per acre . If we . paid that fee we would be covered but we still would have to buy credits from . NCL . The end result would be EOTT would have 15 . 3 acres of unused credit in . KWB's bank . Cheryl would like to charge EOTT the difference between NCL . credit and KWB credits . If NCL credits are $ 1500 . 00 per acre we would own . KWB $ 500 . 00 per acre for being covered under there Master Permit . Cheryl has . a call into Mark Poe for this information and he has not returned her call . I . spoke with Mark this morning about this issue , he said compensation credit . prices had increased and was not sure what he quoted Gary . Mark will verify . and get back to me . Scott if you can find anything in Gary's files about this . that would be great . . Edward Attanasio . 02 / 26 / 2001 11 : 36 AM

Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets . Wow ! What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition . . For every good bit of news ( Pat Wood , one of our heroes at CAEM , being . selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , and the . continuing progress that the Canadians - yes , the Canadians - have made . towards energy competition ) , we have had to bear one disaster and misstep . after another throughout the year . Let's see , in December 2000 , who could . have predicted . . . 1 . The tragic events of September 11th . . 2 . The California implosion . . 3 . Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment . . 4 . Price volatility and high prices ( but it could have been worse if Mother . Nature did not help out ) . . 5 . Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring . . 6 . Enron collapse . . 7 . FERC Blinks on Super RTO . . 8 . Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market . . 9 . No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring . . 2001 was one heck of a year - but thankfully , probably the nadir of the . movement towards energy competition in North America . As CAEM looks into . our crystal ball ( natural gas fired , of course ) for the coming year , we see . a better year . Below are some of the predictions and responses from the . CAEM staff about what we expect to occur . The responses below are primarily . concerned with electricity , but to a lesser extent , may be applied to . natural gas as well . . As always , do not bet the house on what we have to say . We are just a . little think tank , kind of like the little engine that could . And we can . . And we do . . Happy New Year ! . The CAEM Staff . P . S . If you would like to add a prediction or two , please send an e - mail . with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan @ caem . org . We will post them to our web site - www . caem . org Please identify which . question below is being addressed by your prediction .

The PPA auction is going along well I think . We are leading on Sundance B . and have been for 3 rounds now . Some weird things are occuring so it is too . early to tell what will utimately happen . The government has said that it . will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning . We . would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B . . Currently we are bid $ 112 , 000 , 000 Canadian and a swap price of 33 . 5 CAD . . But again its too early to get our hopes up .
Greg . I was talking with George Wasaff yesterday and he recommended I touch base . with you in an effort to identify potential Enron interest in acquiring . WaterDesk assets . . WaterDesk Corp . was incubated by Azurix to provide participants in the . global water industry with a global , single - source , collaborative , . business - to - business network to efficiently source , transact and manage , . information , products and services . We are currently involved in a private . placement process that does portend some significant possibility for success . but has not had anyone circle an offer yet . Time is of the essence . Given . current market and industry realities , our priorities have changed in an . effort to maximize near term opportunity for success . Specifically , in . addition to offering investors the opportunity to invest in a public . marketplace solution , we are pursuing other avenues , such as private . marketplace or buy - side procurement solutions ( which seem to be more . palatable ) . We are also broadening our opportunity set by seeking potential . solutions outside the water industry . Feedback from the various and numerous . entities that have performed due diligence on WaterDesk indicate that its . assets are well suited for any of these alternative solutions . . KEY ELEMENTS OF VALUE : a qualified and experienced team ; intellectual . property ; and , a secure , integrated and operational platform . . Bottom Line : I have committed to John Garrison that we will deliver some form . of success by February or we should """" pull the plug """" . It would be a pity to . waste such valuable assets ( human and physical ) . I would like to meet with . your or your designated representative ( s ) as soon as possible to determine . what fit , if any , there might be with Enron endeavors , current or future . . The attached provides some detailed information that may be of help as you . reflect on this . . Alex Perwich . President . WaterDesk Corp . . 713 - 646 - 9573 ( O ) . 713 - 646 - 7800 ( fax ) .

Just a reminder that when entering a wheel , the Interchange ID must be the . same for the import and export . When the Import is labeled as """" EPMI_CISO_ * * """" . and the Export as """" CISO_EPMI_ * * , """" the ISO views these as unique imports and . exports .

This goes to a discussion I had with Jeff this morning .

I . have talked to Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield and have been trying to . reach Beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an IT . perspective . The problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a . different problem every day ( metacalc , servers going down , Lotus Notes . problems . . . ) . I will talk to Beth and let you know if we need to escalate . . I would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that . these problems do not continue . . -

Greg , . As you asked , I have taken a quick look at Global Crossing . I think it is a close call , but they certainly have a decent shot of making it ( by """" making it """" I mean the equity will have value and the company will not be restructured through bankruptcy ) . Their assets , customers , and cash might marginally outweigh the debt load that the company has . . Most importantly , they definitely have a currency ( Global Crossing stock ) that has more value than anything in EBS . If there is a potential deal to contribute assets of EBS into Global Crossing in exchange for equity , then I would recommend pursuing it even if it means contributing up to $ 100 million in cash to get it done . However , I would make sure that Enron has no more contingent liabilities , consolidated burn or cash commitments . The real question is will Global Crossing want what we have at any price . I suspect that once they perform due diligence , they will """" run away """" ( just as the knights did when faced with the killer rabbit in Monte Python's Search for the Holy Grail ) . . Thanks , . KG

I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the . speed issues of the V @ R calculations - here's the response . . . . I spoke with Steve Stock , the Director of RAC systems . He agreed that there . are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review . being conducted by my application architecture group .

To : CMTA Members . From : Brian McMahon . Date : October 2 , 2001 . Re : Employment Training Funds Available to CMTA Members . 2001 has been a trying year for many of our members . The national . economic slowdown has been compounded here in the state as a result of . energy issues and 'California - only' mandates on employers . . One way CMTA is helping companies offset the state's high cost of doing . business is by offering a free program to help acquire state funds for . their employment training needs . . Please take a moment to go to our ETP program webpage at . http : / / www . cmta . net / member / etpmrktg . shtml to see how you might be . able to take advantage of these services .
Greg , . I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions : . 1 ) . This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms . We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this ( CommodityLogic et al . . . ) . 2 ) . I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset - based trading be just another business unit like EES was . but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform . . I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest . . Good luck , . Andy

Before we carry this much further , let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place . . We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero . Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption , as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now ( unless you include DWR costs ) , which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC . AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality . . Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b / c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re : CTC , but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b / c no one can agree on what PX credit ( """" market """" price ) is now that there is no PX . Besides , though SCE and PG & E are arguing for different methods ( the so - called """" top - down """" and """" bottom - up """" ) , in the end the result will be about the same ( CTC = 0 ) , especially now that PG & E has supposedly stopped """" adjusting """" the PX credit to recover past undercollections . And of course , the DWR contracts muddy the waters , since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs , then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation . Bottom line : we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run . . In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit , we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T & D only , and that CTC should become a relic of the past . . I think by now it may be a dead issue - - I believe AA has accepted our arguments w / o this extra bit of persuasion , else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne . Thanks for all the background and input from everyone , and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context .
I just received a call from the Venezuelan Ambassador . He said he did everything he could to squeeze in some time with Chavez next week , but that Chavez's revised itinerary ( he's leaving a day earlier and arriving half a day later than originally scheduled ) has resulted in the ambassador's being asked to take a few things off the schedule to loosen things up , and he can't accommodate our request . He was apologetic and offered to assist us in trying to make arrangements for a Caracas meeting . Sorry this didn't work . Let me know if you guys would like me to pursue this further on the London end . . Jim . - -

Mike Day believes that SCE might agree to a new Stipulation in which they commit to pay our claim if their new deal and their pending Advice Letter are approved by the CPUC . I have scheduled a call for tomorrow at 12 : 30 CST to discuss the terms we would like to see in the Stipulation ( e . g . , drop approval of the Advice Letter as a condition , payment within 10 days after CPUC approval , agreement on the number set forth in our response to their Data Request , agreement to apply accrued negative CTC credits to current T & D charges , to name a few ) . On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest , in view of the SCE Counterclaim . Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed , so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement .

I'm sorry I haven't been more involved is setting this up , but I think the agenda looks kond of soft . At a minimum , I would like to turn the schedule around and hit the hard subjects like Q3 , risk management , and asset sales first . I would also like to see a discussion on our funds flow , cash flow , and our balance sheet . If we don't get these things right , none of the rest of it matters . . Also , I notice that Cindy Olson and Beth Tilney are in attendance . This should only be for presentation , as they are not members of the management committee . It also seems a bit unusual to have Beth Tilney present for a discussion on company image and presentation , and not have Mark Palmer . . - -

Dan , as per my voice - mail , I talked to Hunter and he confirmed that Enron . would notify BP / Crestar via e - mail by 9 : 45 MST of the contracts with . associated volumes . On the chance that Enron cannot notify BP / Crestar or . fails to take , and BP / Crestar incur penalty costs then Enron would pay for . those as per point number # 2 below ie . , . [ ( 2 ) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment . agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and / or take , then any penalty . costs / price difference incurred by Crestar / BP shall be passed onto Enron . ] . Hunter agreed as long as there is a reciprocal clause that Enron is . compensated when BP / Crestar fail to nominate by the 10 : 30am MST Timely . cycle deadline and Enron incurs costs , then BP / Crestar would pay those . costs . . Crestar and BP both agree with the reciprocal cost provisions . Now it is a . matter of where the language should go . I think it should be in the Enron . contract . . Please advise if you agree and how we should proceed to include the . language in the Enron contract . . Thanks , . . Bruce Kohrs . Phone : ( 403 ) 205 - 7684 .

Mark - . I work in the middle market group in the Portland West Power Group . I feel . that this year there have been some issues regarding turning around certain . legal financial tasks . A good example to look at is the SMUD ISDA contract . . This counterparty transacted with our weather desk in a breakthrough deal . that began in October . Both Enron and SMUD are still struggling to sign the . ISDA . Part of the reason for the delay in signing was the difficulty I had . in getting someone in legal to get the process going before the deal . transacted . I probably began speaking with someone ( I think is was Sara ) at . least several months prior to the closing of the deal but never made any . progress . Ultimately I got frustrated and left the process to Gary Taylor in . the weather group to deal with ( I was merely supporting him since I had a . relationship with SMUD ) . . Although I historically felt Sara Shackelton was the west power contact for . such matters she seems overwhelmed with many other groups needs . I am . interested in one contact for our group that can turn things around in a . timely manner . I think from what I heard from other in my group that my . opinion is commonly shared . I have tired to bring this issue up with Mark . Taylor since early September yet after trying to call him several times and . sending two emails I have given up trying to contact him ( this seems ironic . given the subject I wanted to discuss with him ) . . I would welcome any insight you can provide . One thought I had was to have a . lawyer who represents both financial and physical issues ( Shari Stack seems . to be qualified to represent both sides and she works for the West ) . My . group has become used to speedy reponse on the physical side and perhaps has . high expectations on all legal matter . You can reach me at 503 - 464 - 3810 . . Thanks . . Stewart

Sorry you weren't able to join my hunting boondoggle in SoDak ! It was epic . . Lots of birds ( the wild variety , not pen raised and tied down like at . Pheasant Haven ! ) We saw literally 1500 - 2000 birds over three days of . hunting , and limited out every day . Got my first double - - two shots , two . birds , nothun' but net . You gonna be at the mgt conf ? I'd love to get . caught up with you and share some new tales of woe from the pipeline . group . PS , I met Angie Green yesterday - - very sharp young lady .

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon . According to Luis Otavio and Fred , customers A ( alta tens ? o , and demand greater than 2 . 5MW ) will ONLY be allowed to sell """" excess power """" not consumed ( capped at their """" cota """" or """" meta """" or quota ) to OTHERS CONSUMERS , but not to MARKETERS . The reason for this is that ANEEL / Parente don't want to """" flood """" MAE with positions to settle ( the argument is , if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties , they won't be able to manage several hundreds ) . But it's crazy : all unbalanced ( net ) positions will be settled in spot market : if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries , there will be hundreds of net , bilateral positions to settle ( and it WILL flood MAE ) , if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE . . This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT . The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers . . It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power , and settle their net position ( net position only ) in spot market . EOL will be a great tool for this , and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new , different product ( """" Restricted Power """" ) . Orlando Gonzalez . 05 / 25 / 2001 08 : 52 AM

Additional information on the delineators . The delineator upgrades were installed with the exception of one console that had to be sent back for modifications . The vendor understands the urgency and hopes to get it back quickly . . A separate issue which is not addressed in this update is the issue of the use of 31 day charts which are not able to be read by the delineators . There was discussion of reverting back to 16 day charts but I do not know where that stands . . cvb . - -

The suc set has been rasied back up to 687 which is about as low as we can go on this unit . We were real close to tripping the unit on low suc press . The reason is that the reading we are getting for the suc . pressure is in the YARD and the trip alarm for the unit is set off the press on the UNIT itself , so the press at the UNIT is lower than the reading in the YARD . If you have any questions refer them to CHRIS GASTON San Juan Team .

Accomplishments : . Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week . Scheduled workshops with NEPCO . Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are . arranging appropriate resources . Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting ( we are . sharing data from workshops ) . Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops . for them . Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the . multiple environments , extraction and analysis tools being used by the . different business units . Upcoming : . Additional workshops for EECC and ESA . Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made . available ( and subjects they would like to cover ) . Will complete the """" user """" guides with screen prints to give out to all . participants ( step by step instructions , tools , and tips ) . Finalize the NEPCO workshops ( Mar 20 - 22 ) . Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review . Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops : . Our overall belief is that the workshops , the one on one attention , the new . content etc . are being received very well ( scores averages around 3 . 5 on a . scale of 1 - 4 ) . The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is . still too low ( average of 2 . 8 ) . We will continue to analyze the root cause . of this problem . . There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules . contain which data . We believe that a hand - out we developed really helped . this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning . . Comments received : . Very good and useful . Could have used this sooner . Sessions are not long enough . I love the workshop idea , its so much better than training classes . Feel free to contact me , Melissa or Kim with any questions or concerns . . Greg

Dear Ms . Beck , . I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron . I have . long been interested in a career in business , and I would love the . opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer . . As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club ( HEC ) and various . entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to . form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization , I have learned a . great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective . . This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as . well . I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian . Impact to help us raise money for outreach events . I am also co - leading . the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer . Because . this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer , . I will be in Houston from mid - July to mid - September . If there is a . position available at Enron , I would enjoy working for it while I am here . . I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world . . The combination of resourcefulness , rigorous logic , and creativity called . for in the business sphere intrigues me . The integration of global and . analytical thinking also piques my interest . I have attached my resume for . you to review , I will be in Houston from March 27 - 31 if you would like to . interview me . Thank you for your consideration . I look forward to hearing . from you ! . Sincerely , . Natalie Carnes . - Resume4 . doc

The CPUC has issued a Notice of the Prehearing Conference for PG & E's Gas Accord II filing to be held on January 7 , 2002 . Prehearing conference statements are to be filed by January 2 , 2002 . You may recall that the PG & E filing in October was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of Jan . 1 , 2003 through Dec . 31 , 2004 . They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets . . Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact . In that regard , Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG & E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call . . Given our initial reaction to this filing , to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan ? At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us . However given our cash concerns , before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track .

As an FYI for those not already in the loop , new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April , and it seems the process of administering them is foggy . . So here is an outline of the R & R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings : . Broadly , I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process . However , exceptions can take one of two forms : . Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations ; . Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors ; . For either , tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary ( generally Global ops in the former case and RAC / Research in the latter ) . . Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools . . Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work . . Rgds .

Summary - We discussed a public position of """" No PPO without an RTO """" since . without a functioning market , Enron is at risk with our current book of . business . From a public policy standpoint , we would argue that without the . protection of the PPO , customers need a functioning market in which to . procure power . . Privately , in exchange for supporting the Com Ed Proposal , we would negotiate . for the following ( in order of importance ) : . 1 . No losses on our existing book of business by negotiating a bulk power . deal to cover our exposure . . 2 . Build a broad market by seeking changes to Com Ed FERC tariffs as it . regards balancing and penalties , etc . . As a separate matter or in conjunction with the above , do a default service . or some other related deal . A meeting is scheduled for Friday with Chuck .

I have not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower . His . concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate . IT is currently . working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use . IT is also working on . correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly . London trades . many more swaptions and asian options than the US ; therefore , the impact of . not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them . . The majority of options in the U . S . are European monthly and daily exercises . and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals . The . idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US , but other . more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal . specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have . Once the technology is . in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt . The system was . originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US . and as new markets and new ideas ( such as the US becoming more and more of a . financial market ) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit . Swaption . vols and asian options are two of these enhancements . . Also , it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower . We have in stage an . option sensitivity matrix that , once implemented into production . I will be . sure that James knows about . It probably will not solve all his problems , . but it will give him a starting place . . Stacey . Enron North America Corp .

The rules appear to be cut and dry . Basically , = . . for them to have a full corporate membership Enron would have to own less = . . than 5 % to avoid the common ownership criteria for EPMI . . I spoke to Marianne after the Board Meeting . She felt uncomfortable when I = . . told her the I was upset because I did not know about the appeal and that t = . he . way that the appeal was handled at the board . Short answer is that Mariann = . e . did not feel at liberty to tell us about the appeal for whatever reason . . It appears that we will be the only representation that TNPC will have for = . . their REP . I will bridge the gap with Susan Burton in the Austin office to = . . try and help them with their issues . One problem is that in her attempts t = . o . = 01 & show = 018 that they are not controlled by ENRON , I sense a reluctance on = . her . part to be forth coming with their issues . I have spoken to others at TNPC = . . that are willing to discuss issues and how we can support them . . - -

Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed . to resolve these issues with Transco , BUG , LILCO and Enron . The total . dollars . required was approximately $ 4 . 25 million . An amount of $ 3 . 55 million needed . for . the Transco historical imbalance resolution . The remaining balance was needed . for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention . last year . . Bob Hall has $ 3 . 5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical . imbalance . . The remaining $ 50 , 000 for Transco and approximately $ 700 , 000 of additional . funds . for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under """" The Office of . the . Chairman """" . Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money . to . be reserved at the """" Chairman """" level since the additional funds were needed to . correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P & L . . Also , the . arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement . payments . were made by Enron . . As with most stories , there is some good news and some bad news . First , the . bad news . . After a great deal of investigation , it appears that there currently is no . reserve at the . """" Office of the Chairman """" for these additional funds . Now , the good news . . Georgeanne . will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that . we can . quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco . .

On August 16 , 2001 , Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year . The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for , and for the most part , Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested . Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money , it was imperative that ( 1 ) the data be pulled together , even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible ; ( 2 ) the data be as accurate as possible , and ; ( 3 ) it be done in a very short period of time . . The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive . Utilizing Cara's comprehensive , and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems , we were able to accomplish this task . There were many instances where we hit a """" brick wall """" . Specifically , it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset , although it was imperative we do so . Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap . . As a result of her efforts , we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC , and subsequently for our FERC filing . I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $ 2 , 000 . . Sean Crandall . ( Amy . Is this good enough ? )

Happy Holidays ! . We have a few problems with deals with EES . We have tried to get them . straightened out here , but I think it has come to the traders duking it out . . Our contact at EES , Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and . they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals . . Deal # 481619 should be $ 145 . 00 even . The trader says the deal was done . direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge . Deal # 480433 should be killed . . Deal # 481620 is not input correctly . This is another one where the hours . have been duplicated . The first strip and the last strip repeat 10 / 29 for . the same hours . This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount . that flows that day which is 400 . . Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas , ya' hear !

I am happy to keep Littlechild's output separate from what you will write about EU - wide energy liberalisation , Peter . . I hear your conference in Brussels went quite well . I hope Brendan and Doug both played their parts adequately ? . I have asked Pamela to try to track you down in Florence or Dundee ( not sure I have a tel . no . for former . ) If you have definitely been tasked with producing an EU Institute paper for the Barcelona EU Heads of State economic summit next Spring , to support progression of the liberalisation acceleration legislation , then I can give you plenty of ideas about justification and the practical differences it could make . We can have a preliminary talk by phone . After that I reckon it would be worth my collecting together some written material for you and then meeting . I assume that private funding is not required in this instance . . I am leaving Washington this afternoon , and should be back in circulation in Brussels later this week . Kind regards , . Peter . .

Hello ! Rick , . Yesterday , we received a call from the AMEE ( Mexican Association of Electric Power ) , where Ricardo is the Vice - president of de - regulation and open access , regarding to the six - month ? s payment to the AMEE . This payment is for $ 900 dollars or $ 9000 pesos . I just wanted to ask you if we should continue or not our relationship with the AMEE . Last Friday we were invited by the AMME to a working breakfast with Senator Genaro Borrego , where he explained to us his proposal related to the energy sector reform . . Below you will find a brief description of the AMEE . . The AMEE was created on February of 1999 , after President Ernesto Zedillo sent an initiative to Congress for the restructuring of the Electric Industry . From that moment the intention of the AMEE has been to actively participate in the discussions and of course in the opening of the electric market for the private investment . . This association allows the participation of all of the members of the industry that have interest in promoting the AMEE ? s ideas and are willing to contribute with their ideas to the opening of the energy industry . The AMEE is an organism that has had access to privilege information for its analyses from the government authorities and the Congress . In fact , the AMEE is negotiating the best conditions for the opening and de - regulation of the market with them . The AMEE has work teams with the CFE , the CRE ( regulatory entity ) , Pemex , the Secretariat of Energy and with the National Commission for energy savings . . The AMEE has organized working breakfasts with members of the Congress , and co - organizing events like the Power - Mex 2001 , co - generation seminars and specialized conferences related to the energy area , etc . . Regards , . Kikumi

Correct . . . . our intent is to err on the side of conservatism with respect to . pulling credits off the ok list and then put them back on as and when the . legal and commercial due diligence suggests that it is prudent . It is . definately impractical to ask for specific consent from each reference credit . as we can probably expect many of the consent docs to make it into the bin . . I have drafted an initial notification letter and will forward for review . tomorrow . I think that it is so unlikely that cp's will sign and mail back . a formal consent that we should consider delisting them instead of asking for . consent . If we are successful in building the business as a standard for . price discovery and liquidity , companies will ask us to quote on them . . Bradford is taking a final pass through the reference credits and I will . forward the pared down list on asap . . bryan . Louise Kitchen . 19 / 01 / 2000 20 : 15

Dear Ken , . I spoke to Bonnie today regarding the letter I sent you on September . 12th . Bonnie suggested I follow - up that letter with this email . . With only 49 days to the election , we expect to see the oppositions' . advertisements on television and radio and in the mail in the next two . weeks . It's crucial to our ability to be competitive that we complete . our media buys and print our next two direct mail pieces by October . 1st . If we do , we know that we can win . . Your initial contribution of $ 100 , 000 allowed us to do the first direct . mail piece to 250 , 000 households ( a sample was included with the letter . I sent to you on the 12th ) . We need to do at least two more of these . mailings for our direct mail effort to be truly effective at a total . cost of $ 190 , 000 for both ( including postage ) . . To date , the combined total of contributions to the political campaign . and the public education campaign is just over $ 1 , 040 , 000 . We expect an . additional $ 150 , 000 in pledges and new contributions in the next two to . three weeks . While we are actively soliciting others for help , we are . currently left with a shortfall of $ 310 , 000 to meet our minimum budget . of $ 1 . 5 million . ( This budget would include the production and mailing . of the three mail pieces described above ) . Ken , the campaign is at a crossroads . I cannot underscore enough how . important your additional financial help is at this time . And , I cannot . underscore enough how important one last significant contribution from . you would be to our success on November 7th . . If you have any questions , or need additional information , please do not . hesitate to call me at ( 573 ) 446 - 3129 or reply to this email message . . Thank you for your past support and , hopefully , your additional . support . Passing Proposition A is a once in a generation opportunity . . I look forward to hearing from you soon . . Sincerely , . Karl

Mr . Lay - - . I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports . Facilities , L . P . , and I am in the process of coordinating the $ 1 . 4 million . prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by . the partners to the referendum campaign . . Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority , we expect . to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this . week . The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the . partnership , on behalf of each partner , upon receipt of instructions from . each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed . to the campaign instead of being distributed . I have discussed this . procedure with Sue Walden . . With respect to your arrangement with Shell , we were not sure what you and . Shell had agreed to . The monies being contributed to the referendum . campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action . committee ( as required by law ) . This special purpose PAC is subject to the . general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising . As you know , one of . these laws provides that """" a person may not knowingly make or authorize a . political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the . person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the . person actually making the contribution . . . . """" Pending a better . understanding of the Shell arrangement , we will hold Shell's $ 100 , 000 in the . partnership's account . . Please contact John Watson at 713 - 758 - 2556 or me at 713 - 758 - 2350 if you have . any questions regarding the foregoing . . Sincerely , . Michael S . Telle

Yesterday's ( Tues ) Electric Power Daily reports that EEI has assembled a task force of industry executives to assess their systems after last week's tragedy and to report on legislative changes that may be necessary to promote the reliability of the grid . There is also a report on the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Consortium that is doing some study . That spokesperson says that deregulation brings lower reliability due to reduction in operating margins . I don't know if Enron was asked to participate in either of these , but the results , if solely based on input of those that don't want deregulation , could certainly be used to slow things down .
Nobody could do this today . We will schedule for next week . . Regards , . Rob

Lorraine , I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for . the change . However , I would ask that we eliminate the word """" volumetric """" as . that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world . I . e . , if we were truly . to have """" volumetric """" rates ( like Northern ) we'd have to file a whole new rate . schedule ! I just don't want to use this word .

Richard , . Here's a version that reflects changes we discussed this afternoon . I've deleted the Energy Supply Option section from the Product Approval Template since the provision does not exist in the TC or Master Agreement . A metering Special Term and Condition has been added to this draft . The EESI section is now more broad regarding the quarterly billing adjustment . . I didn't add language to the """" Conversion to Fixed """" section yet . I'm not sure how to word what you wanted . . . any suggestions ? . This revised TC hasn't been reviewed by Mike Smith yet , so if you have any specific changes please let me know . . Thanks ! . Bob

FYI below from Webb on the project with Webb and Vince Kaminski ( EOL trade data ) . . Also , on 2002 budget , we agreed with EA OTC ( Louise ) yesterday on their total ENW budget for 2002 broken out into EnronOnline , Operations , Systems Development and IT Infrastructure for both expense and capital with Systems Development broken in to two portions , one supported by operations and one supported by gas and power commercial . We will work with EA , EGM , EIM , and EEL next week to see if we can get them to accept a pricing structure for EOL that is more service and transaction based . Brad is working with Louise , Sheriff and Shankman on this and our goal is to get something structured in this manner . . We also plan to get the EIM and EGM OTCs to agree to their complete budgets early next week . ENW also has a meeting with the EES OTC on their ENW budget next week . . Due to all these numbers moving around so much ( mostly down ) and in an effort to keep Kerry Roper , Sally Beck and Pickering focused on making progress with the business units , I am going to wait until next Tuesday or Wednesday to have a new ENW 2002 packet sent to you if that is OK . Since we met with you on the total ENW budget on October 15th , EA alone went down $ 6 million in expense and $ 31 million in capital . We are making good progress down on EIM and EGM as well . EES might be a different story . . When you get that packet , you will see 2001 forecast vs . 2002 plan on the date we met you ( October 15th ) vs . where we are on October 22nd for 2002 Plan . You will also have the total IT depreciation across EA , EGM , EIM , EES , EEL , ENW , EBS . This is slowly trickling in but we feel good that we can get it right . . Please e - mail me back if you need anything sooner or if you have any questions or comments . . Thanks . . Piper . - -

I inserted the missing table :
Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing . our relationships or commercial prospects . . Overall , we respect the effort , but California failed to get the ball over . the goal line : . On Siting . Intentionally or not , California has designed power plant siting laws that . make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state . . Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental . quality in California . . That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are . going outside the state to build power plants . . Tinkering around the edges won't help ; and ( with all due respect ) the . legislation passed yesterday tinkers . . Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to . keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price . spikes . . If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a . dozen - - or more - - state and local agencies , California's supply problems will . continue , or worsen . . California needs real , one - stop shopping and it needs it now . . On the retail price cap . They don't work ( we've already developed all the arguments , so I won't repeat . them hear ) . The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply . puts off the day of reckoning . . It's like using your credit card - - eventually they're going to knock on your . door to collect . . Now , families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets . because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a . couple of years down the road . . So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG & E will pay the same . amount , but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use . electricity wisely . . There's a better answer : . Instead of urging consumers not to switch , encourage customers to sign with . another retail provider . . Clearly , the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision . makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals . with companies like Enron . But for the press reports , they hardly know . there's a crisis .

Bill . This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know . As a result , significantly more new transactions are being booked to """" New Counterpart """" than can be cleaned up from historical deals . As Credit has been emphasizing for some months now , this is not acceptable for this business , is not maintainable ( proof in the attached report ) and IT resources are required to automate current manual processes . . Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of new counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in conjunction with our credit response prior to booking ( expected delivery next Monday0 . However , the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID . Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested within the week . Then , downstream processing through to billing may benefit . . Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up the counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and map the counterpart in RPS and RGS ( both have been manual procesess , the latter severly under resourced ) . . Once this is implemented , EES has over 20 , 000 Mass Market transactions executed now , so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog . More importantly , three companies have already filed bankruptcy . We must complete these efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events . . Regards . Molly . - -

I spoke with ABAG attorney Kenneth Moy and APS attorney Dan Douglas . . Neither was thrilled with the Wood / Barnett draw , but neither was immediately . warm to the notion of a negotiated continuance . I outlined the arguments . against charging into the guns of Wood and Barnett , and reminded them that . there could very likely be delays anyway as a result of the CPUC's continued . indecision about the end of the rate freeze - - which looks to be increasing as . a result of the Administration's deadlock with the utilities . They both . indicated that they would discuss the matter with their clients and get back . to us shortly . I suspect at least one of them will say """" no we want to go . ahead even if you do not .

Monroe Whitaker . 267 Western Avenue . Brattleboro , VT 05301 . fmwhit @ sover . net . To Mr . Ken Lay , . I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds , such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH , that benefit the company's employees , who lost their retirement savings , and provide relief to low - income consumers in California , who can't afford to pay their energy bills . Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees . . Indeed , while you netted well over a $ 100 million , many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out . And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year . As a result , there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt . . The New York Times reported that you sold $ 101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it . Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings . . Sincerely , . Monroe Whitaker

I'm on vacation next week , but would be happy to get together first thing the . following week to discuss . . Also , in response to a voicemail that I received , wanted to let folks know . that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today . The legislature is , however , . holding hearings , taking a """" comprehensive view """" of the industry ( i . e . , . focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity """" price gouging """" ) . They . held their first hearing today , but it got cut short due to activities . underway in the Legislature . I believe that , prior to cutting the hearing . short , the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers , who told . stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship . . One panel participant ( Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms , I believe ) . waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and . December . I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting . the PUC to appear that it's doing something . I'll report more on the . Legislative hearings as they occur . . Best , . Jeff .

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds , such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH , that benefit the company's employees , who lost their retirement savings , and provide relief to low - income consumers in California , who can't afford to pay their energy bills . Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees . . Indeed , while you netted well over a $ 100 million , many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out . And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year . As a result , there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt . . The New York Times reported that you sold $ 101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it . Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings . . Sincerely , . Susan Vancil

John - - Kevin Presto , head of East Power Trading , had these comments : . Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards - - Kevin says , """" NERC should be eliminated . """" . Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure : - - Kevin says that the """" uniform reporting to consumers , in monthly electric bills , of the known energy sources """" is not good because it supports day - ahead source requirements for retail suppliers . Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose how to source their portfolio , whether from bilateral contracts done on an ahead basis or purchases in the spot market . . John , the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill may alleviate this concern , but I don't know enough about how that works . Several years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clean energy generator and it can trade those credits . Therefore , the seller of clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean credits in order to claim it sold clean energy ( meaning that the clean generator was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount of credits ) . That program recognized that you can't specifically source a clean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way . Thus , portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported . But I don't know how this bill's provisions would work . You probably have the Enron experts on this ( used to be Janel G . ) Thanks .
Looks to me like notice will be given Wednesday or Thursday . . The changes are being made to the CA I documents now . . Kay

As you are already aware , the West desk is making efforts to introduce . financial trading . I met with a customer of John Malowney's this afternoon , . a fellow from a small Oregon PUD named Clatskanie , ( pronounced clask , as in . ask , uh nigh ) the name of a tribe of Indians that I am sure Lewis and Clark . dealt with on their way down river in 1805 and about which I will hereby . discipline myself to digress no further except to mention in passing that . there is an excavation site of one of their villages alluded to in the . Journals , not far from the Portland airport ) anyway , this customer is . reviewing an ISDA and says there is an association of Oregon utilities that . share legal counsel and they are all edging ahead with ISDA review . One gets . the sense of a kind of imperceptible glacial movement turning into visible . creeping . I stepped up to the plate and said Enron legal would leave no . stone unturned in working with their association and we would be happy to get . our ISDA attorney's in Houston to work on a cost effective basis with their . association to promote this ISDA eductation process and on and on . He said . he would give my card to various lawyers and call us back . So , this is a . heads up about what may become an important opportunity for us to creep . somewhat more rapidly into the financial trading market up here . I realize . that resources in the financial trading group are spread thin but would like . to urge you to keep this kind of western initiative in mind . Wouldn't it be . ironic if the first city to string an electric wire ( 14 miles from Willamette . Falls at Oregon City , capital of the Oregon Territory , to downtown Portland ) . for the public sale of electricity would lead the charge to embracing . financial power trading ? I will keep you posted and try not to write . messages so soon after drinking Starbuck coffee . . - - cgy

Our efforts with the Governors have been productive from a GA standpoint and may be prove fruitful from a business develop standpoint as well . Given FERC's issuance of their price cap order , Sue , Scott and I have been reviewing various options for staying relevant to the Governors . .

Greetings : . Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what . happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the . following . . Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table . For California . it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown ( newly appointed CA PUC . Commissioner ) . . Hertzberg did a credible , matter - of - fact job of explaining what California's . doing to resolve the crisis ( nice to know that there's someone out there who . can explain what the heck California's doing ) . Hertzberg then asked that . FERC do """" its part """" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets . . Hertzberg didn't mention the PG & E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison . . Overall , the """" no price cap """" message won the day ( though Breathitt seems to be . under considerable pressure to give in to caps ) . . The Governor of Arizona ( Jane Hull ) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by . 9 republicant governors opposing price caps . Sue will be distributing the . letter . . Best , . Jeff

With regard to your open season testimony , I would remove the last paragraph . ( noted below ) on market concentration . """" As noted above , the concentration limit applies only in the primary market . . There are currently no controls in these rules against market concentration in . the secondary market . While the unconstricted nature of the secondary market . will facilitate more and new entrants in the capacity market , this fluid . quality . nevertheless creates a risk of concentration , insofar as capacity that was . awarded in the initial Open Season may be assigned to any creditworthy market . participant and without market share limits . Indeed , the Comprehensive . Settlement does not provide for a mandatory electronic bulletin board for . secondary market trades and , accordingly , tracking secondary market trades . would . be complicated and administratively infeasible . Nonetheless , the Commission . should remain cognizant of the risk of market concentration and commit to . respond to any such complaints raised by market participants . """" . With all due respect , it is a rather transparent attempt to get the Commission . to focus on on the secondary market issue . We agreed to exclude secondary . market . acquisitions as a measure of market concentration . The above paragraph signals . the Commission that this is a problem and dilutes the value of the testimony .

Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday , revealing a huge cash drain , despite last week's $ 1 . 5 - bil asset - backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy . Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $ 1 . 2 - bil , even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier , $ 550 - mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $ 3 - bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $ 1 . 9 - bil of commercial paper . Enron blamed operating costs , trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners . Enron said it expects $ 800 - mil soon from asset sales and got another $ 440 - mil bank line Monday . But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment - grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due . That could have a """" material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern , """" it warned . . For Related News , Double Click on one of these codes : .

Susannah dakin . P . O . Box 87 . Oxford , MS 38655 . sferris @ olemiss . edu . To Mr . Ken Lay , . I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds , such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH , that benefit the company's employees , who lost their retirement savings , and provide relief to low - income consumers in California , who can't afford to pay their energy bills . Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees . . Indeed , while you netted well over a $ 100 million , many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out . And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year . As a result , there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt . . The New York Times reported that you sold $ 101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it . Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings . . Sincerely , . Susannah dakin

Mark , I had O & M do a little research on how much we spent in 99 and the . numbers aren't that far off the numbers that were noted on us , which leads me . to believe the competitors numbers a little more . Look at the spreadsheet . below . While our Corp spending was small , over we spent almost $ 800 , 000 as . Enron in whole and that is probably what they were noting . ( I subtracted . Axurix out - that is why the number dropped from 1 . 1 Million ) . . Margaret , . Per our conversation last week , attached is a chart for that outlines Enron's . spending in 1999 .

I asked Ken Cessac to call Jerry Knight , who is the administrative assistant that John Sommer asked Ken to call to get daily PTR from ONEOK . Knight had been sending Ken daily PTR information on a once - weekly basis through September , but then stopped . I asked Ken to ask Knight the obvious question : why did he stop sending Ken the daily PTR ? Ken did so today and was told that Terry Spencer told Knight to stop sending Ken the information . Knight didn't say why he had been told that . Knight told Ken that he would now tell Spencer that Ken had made inquiry about the stoppage of the daily PTR . Ken wondered whether Spencer did this to see if Ken noticed and objected to the lack of daily PTR . Weird . . Ken's letter of today's date regarding the second measurement incident has gone out by telefax to ONEOK . Many thanks to all who responded on that . .

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and . EES to make certain FERC - required filings ( including quarterly power marketer . filings ) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power . into the grid to us . The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for . these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint . . We expect to receive authorization within 60 days . . Generally , industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC . power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements , similar . to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements . EPMI and EES will be able to file . specific industrial purchases in a combined report , rather than requiring the . industrials to file their separate reports with FERC . . Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial . . We need to consider additional costs / back office transaction flags that may . be required in order for us to track these purchases . Thanks . Christi . 37007 . . -

Hunter , . I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday meeting with the EIA in Washington D . C . so I will miss the Tuesday afternoon Trading Track meeting . I think Biliana should spend a few more months in the fundamentals group since she has only been here since mid - February . She has also expressed an interest in spending 2 - 3 months more in the group , and she could benefit from learning about the pipelines in the STP group . . We lose Virawan ( Aug 1st ) , Mat ( Aug 1st ) , and Denver ( Sep 1st ) . . We get Bilal Bajwa ( Jul 1st ) and Jason Wolfe ( Sep 1st ) . We could use two additional Trading Track Analysts / Associates in Jul / Aug to fill out the fundamentals group . If we don't get the people from the Trading Track , I will have to recruit them from the Assoc / Analyst pool . . Let me know if you have any questions . . Chris
DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER . I just spoke with Georgetta Baker , lawyer for SoCalGas , and Rick Miles , FERC's ADR group . We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No . RP01 - 620 ( TW Complaint ) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution ( ADR ) . After discussing the various types of ADR , we agreed to begin with mediation . Rick Miles will be the mediator . . The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution ( i . e . , settlement ) of its claims . Both parties indicated a willingness to settle . Rick Miles will act as a facilitator . Mr . Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative . As the mediation process continues without resolution , Mr . Miles' role will evolve . Later on , if the parties desire , Mr . Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case . Also , if the parties desire , the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits . . Initial dates of November 7 - 8 or November 13 - 14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting . A neutral location needs to be agreed upon . Once additional information is learned , I will advise . In the meantime , if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .

It has come to my attention that changing the operational storage capacity between the Evening process and the NonGrid process can be unduly problematic for customers because most of the pipelines that interconnect with NNG do not recognize the NonGrid process . Such changes can lead to EPSQ issues during the ID1 process when shipper quantities cut during the NonGrid storage allocation end up being less than the EPSQ calculated for ID1 . The differences that result will most probably end up as shipper imbalances on NNG . . For this reason , it is strongly recommended that operational storage capacity not be changed between the Evening and the NonGrid processes in the future .
Here's the latest on the Iowa customer choice bill - - HF # 2530 . As some of you . may have noticed in the trade press , there has started to be alot press . releases from the opponents and proponents of the bill . The opponents are . bringing out AARP and the Office of the Consumer Advocate , the proponents . ( that includes us ) have been putting out positive quotes from the School . boards , the low income community action groups and the retail community . . Radio ads have started running in both the Des Moines area as well in . outstate . . It appears that floor debate will start next Monday , March 27th in the . House . It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days , with . the hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3 , so that . they can spend at least a week on the debate . . The Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed . that moving forward is a good thing , but that he was going to leave it up to . the legislators to either vote it up or down . We believe that if the bill . comes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits , the Governor will . sign it . . There are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces . . . . Enron has . tried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our . business interests in Iowa with Enron Wind . . As I have stated in earlier updates , this bill most likely will not pass . until the last few days of the session , sometime in Mid April .
Rod : . Thanks so much for taking time from your busy schedule to meet with us last . week .

Assemblywoman Corbett will likely propose amendments at Monday's Rev & Tax . Cmte hearing on her AB 128x . Apparently , the amendments will require that . the PUC set a """" fair price """" for electricity . ? Any charges above that fair . price ? will be subject to the proposed excess profits tax . . Also of interest is that the excess profits tax would attempt to apply to . out - of - state companies that sell energy into California . ? They are going to . try to impute nexus to the out - of - state generators by arguing that they are . deriving economic benefit from selling into California and that creates . nexus . . Finally , it appears that the Suspense File will not be invoked in this case . because that policy only applies to Regular Session bills . Obviously , AB . 128x is a Special Session bill . . ? .

Dear Mark ; Thank goodness the election is almost over . We ought to . have a few weeks of peace before someone will start working for 2004 . . The poles have been swamped today and I guess they expect the biggest . vote in the last 40 years . . I am glad the election is nearly overafter almost 2 years I have . heard enough . . I got a new tooth inlay this morning and then voted about 10 : 45 and . already our precinct had had over 180 voters - - your mother was one as she went . before she went to the store . I don't know who she voted for as yet . I was . thinking of putting up some cute sign like ( Monica says """" Back Bill """" ) ; ( Nader . says """" A vote for me is a vote for Bush """" ) ; ( Be sure to get behind the right . Bush ) ; ( Gore is a Kunkle Head ) ; or ( Gore - Gore ) . However I decided to put my . halo back on . You realize I am joking of course . . I watched the Northwestern - Michigan game last saturday - it had to be the . most exciting college game I have ever seen . NW lost the ball on downs when . their star runner ( he had gained 268 yards running ) dropped a pass in the . endzone with no one within 10 yards . All Michigan had to do was run the . clock down ( 1 : 45 left in game ) so I turned to ESPN to try to get a Lehigh . score ( I finally did ) and I never went back to the NW - Mich game . I learned . just as I turned the radio off to sleep about 8 hours later that NW had . recovered a fumble and scored on a pass to win 54 - 51 . NW had beaten . Minnesota the week before on a Hail Mary pass of 50 yards on the last play . of the game . Incidentally Lehigh had beaten Colgate 20 - 14 and they are now . 9 - 0 . . I know you are looking forward to seeing Calvin . I wish I could be a . mouse to see that meeting . I had better leave now . Your Mother said I should . send her love . I add my love to that . DAD
I attended the Senate hearing , and Murkowski strongly supported FERC's . decision and was anti - price cap throughout the hearing . In my opinion , the . author of this article misinterpreted what was going on at the end of the . hearing . Commissioner Massey was trying to offer up a letter supporting . price caps , to be placed into the record . My take is that Murkowski didn't . want the letter and , being totally skeptical of the financeability of . infrastructure under price caps , challenged Massey to come back with support . from the financial community for price caps . .

I'm a recent EBS redeployment person who found a job in ETS . Late last week my group got flat screen monitors to replace the old , large , bulky ones . We moved to 3 Allen Center on Monday evening 9 / 17 . On Tuesday evening , 9 / 18 someone came into this area and stole 2 of the new flat screen monitors . This is being investigated , however , we now have 2 persons without a monitor . . What is happening to all the computer equipment from EBS terminated / redeployed persons ? If we had access to this equipment , the monitors could be quickly replaced . Instead , 2 old , large bulky monitors are being delivered as a """" temporary """" fix while ETS orders new equipment . Why is ETS ordering new equipment when a transfer of computer assets from EBS to ETS could speedily resolve this problem ? . All Enron companies could benefits if the unused equipment from EBS was recycled back into Enron . . Miriam Brabham . ECN3975 . 713 - 345 - 2648 . 713 - 646 - 4794 FAX . miriam_brabham @ enron . com

Mark , David Robyn & Liz , . If you need cash , but don't want to sell stock or options , I have a possible solution . I am currently waiting for approval for a Line of Credit ( LOC ) at PaineWebber . I don't know how much each of you has there , but I have all of my assets ( stocks ) held there , which includes managed accounts ( i . e . , Cypress Asset & TCW ) . If you need funds for something , such as a private investment , a new car or to pay down some other more costly debt , then you can draw on this LOC up to 65 % the value of the collateral . The terms of the LOC does not allow for the purchase public equities ( stocks ) . I will say that we are getting the """" family special """" on this , because this would typically only be offered to clients that had tens of millions with PaineWebber . . The LOC terms are the following : . ( 1 ) Must have combined assets > $ 550 , 000 held at Painewebber ( must be marketable securities , excludes PaineWebber alternative investments ) . ( 2 ) Rate is 30 day - LIBOR plus 45 basis points ( same rate for KLL / LPL ) . ( 3 ) 65 % LTV . Alternatively , you can borrow on your margin account there if you already have one . However , the LTV is only 50 % . . I notified Ann Bennett ( PaineWebber ) today that this might be of interest for some of you . You can call her directly at 713 - 957 - 7042 to set this up . I would be happy to discuss this further with any of you . . Beau

Also , I . located lots of background reading on everything I ever wanted to know about . the swaps market and how we fit in . With Tana """" s help , I also watched the . """" deal tape """" which I found both amusing and informative . . I will be out of the office for most of this afternoon . My recruiter is . available this afternoon to take me around to secure a permanent apartment . closer to work - - in the Montrose or River Oaks area . I quickly decided . that commuting from the burbs is not for me . ( You can take me out of . Manhattan but can't take the Manhattan out of me ) .

The Commission just voted out one half of the """" Bilas Alternate . """" . The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR - based language stating . that the PUC 1 ) would not second - guess DWR purchases and 2 ) would pass . through DWR costs to customers . . However , in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood , the decision removed the . Bilas language on Direct Access . The decision therefore did NOT include the . Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct . Access prohibition . Carl Wood called including Direct Access """" the height of . arrogance . """" . The decision was voted out 3 - 2 , with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting . . That said , the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the . prohibition , and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the . prohibition any time soon . . Best , . Jeff

Members of the Haas Community : . We are all saddened by yesterday's tragic events . This is likely to have . personal ramifications for colleagues , friends , and families with close . connections to the Haas School of Business and UC Berkeley . . Everyone is naturally eager to find out whether anyone from the extended . Haas community has been affected . A website has been put up and is being . used by many business schools to provide information in light of this . national tragedy . The address is http : / / www . finebrand . com / statuses . The . site posts status reports of individuals by school and by class year . We . encourage you to help update this information . Please note , however , that . the School is not able , at this early stage , to confirm the accuracy of the . information posted on this site . . Thank you for helping to alert the Haas community about those who may be in . need of support . This is a sad time for our community and our nation . As . Associate Dean Ben Hermalin counseled us yesterday , we must recognize that . many people will be severely affected by what has happened , and that they . require our sympathy , understanding , and support . . Jay Stowsky . Associate Dean , School Affairs and Initiatives . ( on behalf of Dean Laura Tyson )
Although a final order is not yet available , we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning . It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations , which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC . Highlights include : . In California , refunds / offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX , and only as of October 2 . . Both public and non - public utilities are subject to refund . . It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order , as refined by Judge Wagner . . Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology . . A 10 % creditworthiness premium will be added . . An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology ; it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days . . A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds . It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days , followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days . The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission . An issue will be the definition of """" spot """" transaction for the Pac NW , since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California . . We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues . . RA

Dear Haas Evening MBA Students , . On Friday afternoon November 9 , 2001 , some of the School's most distinguished economists and I will participate in a """" teach - in """" about the US economy . """" Economic Outlook Forum 2001 """" will examine economic conditions in the United States in the wake of the tragic events of September 11 and the ongoing war on terrorism . I am fortunate to co - chair this session with Professor Ben Hermalin , who will begin serving as Interim Dean of the Haas School in January 2002 . Professor Hermalin will moderate the panel presentations and following discussion . In addition to myself , our economic commentators will be Professors Severin Borenstein , Jerry Engel , Rich Lyons , Ken Rosen , Hal Varian , and Janet Yellen . An agenda for the program is attached . . I hope you may be able to join me for the Economic Outlook Forum in the School's Arthur Andersen Auditorium on Friday November 9 , 2001 at 4 : 00pm . Tickets for the program will be available in your program office starting Tuesday evening October 23 . They will be distributed on a first - come , first - served basis . As you know , seating in the auditorium is limited . If you are interested in participating in this discussion , I urge you to obtain a ticket as soon as possible . Out of respect for your fellow students , please do not claim a ticket unless you are sure you will be able to use it . There also will be a limited of standing room tickets available the day of the event . I realize that many of you will not be able to take time away from your jobs to come to Berkeley for this event . I am looking into the possibility of having a Web simulcast of the program in which you could participate . I will keep you apprised about our progress in developing this feature . . I look forward to seeing you at the Economic Outlook Forum and responding to your comments and questions about the economy and about these exceptional national circumstances . . Sincerely , . Laura D'Andrea Tyson . Dean
Historically , I don't think it was an issue before Wheeler Ridge and . the increased flows at that receipt point . Basically there is no minimum . Blythe flows set in the BCAP or by the Commission . It is mainly an . operational issue for SoCalGas that they've somewhat managed without . getting into any Commission mandated procedure . Actually , Florio raised the . issue as it impacts the core but the Commission never addressed it . . Typically , SoCalGas has managed the issue by having the core maintained . flows at Blythe . As I recall there is some manner in which it is indirectly . addressed in the Comprehensive Settlement . . - -

FYI . Here's a note I sent to the large customers . Have spoken with them since . They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides . Also , it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue - - appears that due process / notice requirements prevents it . We're double checking to make sure . .

A hour ahead 24 has been sent to the ISO for 10 . 10 . 01 . . HE 13 - 20 . APX1 SP15 purchase increased by 25 MW . STCA SDG1 load decreased by 25MW . This was due to a scheduling problem which occurred with BPs ( SC ID APX1 ) sale to STCA on 10 . 09 . 01 . They preferred to schedule their sale hour ahead and we have agreed . This will be a one time arrangement . Thanks , Serena
David , you may be getting to the nub here . Ultimately , this is a lot more . art than science . It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision . rule to manage this process . I am looking to the opinions of yourself , Ray , . Dick and Jeff , given the facts in each case , does this appear to be a good . trade given the market , the specifics of the company , the carrying costs of . the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return . assets ( ROCE > 25 % ) . . This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that . comes from this group . As a result , I need to have a positve consensus from . this group in each case . . Regards . Delainey . -

Executive Summary . Marion Horna and Kurt Anderson requested an explanation of how the EW 1 . 5 . Availability was computed . In addition , Barry Riffe and Jeff Duff have . expressed concerns that there is confusion between the EW 750 owners , I . E . , . and EWC on how to categorize ( OOH , UAH , or other ) the direction curtailment & . windshear curtailment for availability computations . The attached memo is . the result of a throrough review of the Exhibits in the 1 . 5 contracts that . define availability and the UAH & OOH clauses which are similar between 1 . 5 . and 750 project contracts . This memo doesn't include a thorough review of . the Technical Specs or Germainisher Lloyd design recommendations for 1 . 5 . projects . This draft memo proposes that : . 1 ) EWC should not be penalized for direction curtailment and windshear . curtailment losses to availability IF that curtailment is in accordance with . the Tech Spec of Germanischer Lloyd recommendations or requirements . . Neither the UAH term or the OOH term in the contract apply . . The corrections applied to correct for windshear in previous EW 750 reports . were made to compensate for the limitations of controller counters . . 2 ) Only those Offline Hrs ordered by the organizations specifically . mentioned in the OOH clause in the contract should be included in the OOH . term in . the contract . For example , if the owner is not specifically mentioned in . the OOH clause then their orders for offline turbine should not be included in . OOH . . The availability resulting from this computation will not penalize . availability for all reasons that the turbine didn't produce power in good . winds . There will be events that prevent turbine production but do not lower . availability , ie . high winds , direction curtailment .

He's not a nazi , he's a commie . Actually he's a democrat but such subtle . distinctions escape me . What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in . DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures . Trading Commission . He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of . financial products like weather hedges , spark spread swaps and similar . industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past . . ( they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX , Chicago Board of . Trade , etc . ) He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff . people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of . products . The current strategy , he explained , was to solve the problem of . the CFTC's arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the . agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were . being sold ( i . e . , the FERC as to energy products ) to regulate the stuff based . on the CFTC's guidance . I assume that Kean's group is on top of this , but I . haven't had the chance to check yet . I talked to a guy in the DC office . about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be . sure they are aware of this leftist plot . I can't remember his name just . now , but he works for Cynthia Sandherr , I think . I'll let you know what is . going on after I talk to those folks . DF

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project , Questar Expansion Approved . posted 10 : 50 AM ( CST ) Dec 13 , 2000 . The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas . Pipe Line ( Transco ) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf / d MarketLink . project , which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to . markets in New Jersey and New York . . Phase I of MarketLink would add 166 , 000 Dth / d of new firm capacity on Transco . to serve five shippers beginning Nov . 1 , 2001 . Phase II would add 130 , 000 . Dth / d to serve two shippers by Nov . 1 2002 . FERC denied requests by the state . of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind . and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire . MarketLink project . However , the Commission is requiring Transco to file . executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four . months of the order . If the contracts are not filed , Transco can not initiate . eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered . by the original certificate . . The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on . non - environmental grounds , saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project . and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public . The . $ 80 . 8 million Questar project would add 272 , 000 Dth / d of capacity . M . L . 104 . would run from coal - seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price , UT , to the . Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River . The project would loop a . portion of Questar's M . L . No . 40 and the entire M . L . No . 41 . Both lines . currently are running full .

Hey team . . I just created deals 456630 ( sale to New Power ) and 456638 ( buy from New . Power ) at the pool . This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New .

I'm using the . following FOM numbers . 1st - 6th 51 , 762 . 7th - 26th 41 , 762 New Power sold back 10 , 000 dth day 7th - 31st . 27th - 31st 31 , 762 New Power sold Aquilla 10 , 000 dth 27th - 31st .

With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people . As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we , ILA , do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business . Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups , both in North America and in Europe , with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer . Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization . For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila . For those not released today , we will need to , as carefully and responsibly as possible , put our beloved company to bed . At the end of this process , the remaining employees , as is true with me , will be let go . . No one is to blame , it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in , and we are left with this ugly choice . Please try to hold your head up , we have built a great company of talented , motivated , creative , and dedicated people . Hold on to your integrity , respect yourself and each other , and remember what a team we have had . . Ed

Update on a new swing supplier as of 4 : 00 PM on Friday . I've called PanCanadian , e prime , Cinergy , Reliant , Coral , ONEOK , and Entergy - Koch . I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back . The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay . ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $ 40 million . . Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers , informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas . . Margaret , it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1 ) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2 ) I've run out of customers to call . . - -

I am delighted to report that I have hired Emily Jelich of Royal Bank of . Canada as the new ISDA General Counsel . Hiring a GC is a great relief to me , . and the fact that Emily has agreed to join us is significant as she has . worked on a number of ISDA initiatives over my tenure as General Counsel . . She is an extremely dedicated ISDA supporter and has brought a thoughtful . perspective to the issues she has been involved with . She will be a strong . addition to our active documentation and netting initiatives . . Emily has worked for the past six years in the legal department at Royal . overseeing many different aspects of their capital markets legal work . Prior . to that she was with the law firm of Blake Cassels and Graydon , formerly an . ISDA member . She has spoken at our Canadian conferences and was also on the . panel at this year's AGM that discussed the Strategic Documentation Review . . In addition to this experience , she is fluent in Russian and Serbo - Croatian , . so we are all set to go when those markets open up ! . Emily will start on June 18 and will be based in New York . .

Mark , attached is the draft of the email to the deal team ( with copies to you . and Dave D ) . [ Distribution ] . Prior to the equity investment in and joint venture with Power Systems . Manufacturing ( """" PSM """" ) , we will need to take the following actions : . + Conduct additional due diligence on the PSM / General Electric ( """" GE """" ) lawsuit . regarding infringement of GE patents . We will need to determine if the . litigation will affect the viability of PSM as the operator or ENA as owner . of the equipment involved in the litigation . This will commence immediately . and a brief legal opinion obtained on these points . . + Conduct legal patent due diligence on the mobile power units that are the . subject of the proposed joint venture and obtain legal opinions with respect . to both the component parts being acquired and the proposed modified units . themselves .

I agree with Milly's comments and concerns in his attached e - mail . . A few points : . 1 . I would send a clarifying memo , and would speak specifically to Diane . Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and . financial power transactions receive legal review . This does not mean that . Linda / Sharon have to document all of them , rather we can still leave it up to . documentation where appropriate . But a lawyer needs to review all power . confirms for the time being ( physical and financial ) to make sure that the . product is being properly defined . . 2 . In terms of power product definition , Milly has raised valid concerns . which warrant legal review , which are market opening risk , change in market . rules between now and market opening , and the size of the transactions being . entered into . There is also the inherent risks of the PPA , in essence . interrutible risk . All these risks need to managed at the front end . i . e . . Once a deal is executed by the trader , the lawyer cannot fix it after the . fact . Although the power traders or originators should already understand . these risks for the product when they are transacting , please meet with . Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks . when they are transacting . . 3 . Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off . execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas . transactions ( i . e . anything over a year must be signed by Milly , if it is . less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or . Davies as the responsible originator ) . I note , however , for the time being , . at least until the market opens , Milly wants to see all power trades . regardless of tenor . . Peter . . -

I just came from the House Ag . Committee where the interested parties have . congregated throughout the negotiations today . Title I and Titles II are . closed , which include the energy / metals exemption language . Tom Briggs and I . have reviewed the latest draft ( minus any changes made in pen by the staff ) . and the language critical to Enron titled """" Legal Certainty for Certian . Transaction in Exempt Commodities """" is identical to that passed out of the . House . This is satisfactory to us . . We hope and expect ( Speaker Hastert has commited to doing so ) to have this . included in the final end of the year omnibus appropriations legislation . . Congress will likely vote on this legislative package on Friday . . This could all come unraveled at this late date , but we are cautiously . optomistic ( George W's words yesterday afternoon . . . so maybe a good omen ) . . Chris and Tom . - -

Dave , I wanted to let you know that I will be in Israel on July 28 , on the . date of the VP pre - ranking . This is a long scheduled family trip that would . be difficult to cancel . I can call in or get all my comments to you and . others ahead of time . Mark
Dad : . Thanks for letting me know . She seemed to be a wonderful person . Things are . going well for me and my family . We bought a place at Silver Shells in . Destin recently . I am hopeful we will get there some during the summers . . Thanks , . Mark
Peter : . You are asking good questions . Generally , most employees are part of ENA and . provide services to all the wholesale businesses . The executives tend to . have their own company business cards and stationary . But , most of the . business continues under ENA or an existing company . Occasionally , . litigation concerns dictate not following the general rules . You can get . more specific info from Julia . . Mark

All , . I am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous James River contract with BPA under favorable terms . The signed agreements are on my desk right now . Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk , the addition of 7 . 5 MW / h and the change of delivery point have added $ 22 . 8 million to the value of the contract . . BPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that ( i ) BPA will deliver 102 MW / h 24 / 7 for the 5 - year term of the agreement ( an increase of 7 . 5 MW / h over the original ) , ( ii ) the disputed """" alternative delivery point """" is designated as Mid - C , ( iii ) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement , ( iv ) the parties agree to """" book out """" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid - C delivery point ( so no power will flow ) ; and ( v ) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement , just as if the power was still flowing . . Although my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement , BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates . Similarly , I had hoped that we could do a one - time book - out , but BPA refused to do so because - - according to BPA's finance personsuch a book - out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark - to - market accounting . Therefore , we executed two documents : one amending the original contract , and another called the """" Book - Out Agreement , """" which sets out an agreement to book - out specific transactions over the next five years . . I am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because ( 1 ) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point , which ( 2 ) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River , and ( 3 ) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $ 22 million in value to the contract . . Thanks to everyone for your help . . Steve

Hello , everyone ! . ? . As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on March 23 may . recall , we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work process be . restructured to a more sequenced approach . ? That is , in the near term we . should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional work . efforts once the critical path items have been more fully developed . . ? . In response to these suggestions , we have substantially revised the RTO West . meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the entire month of . April . ? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO West Stage 2 . Main Page , which you can view by clicking on the link below : . ? . http : / / 208 . 55 . 67 . 64 / Stage2Index . htm . ? . Please note that this revised calendar for the most part . reflects ? cancellations of meetings of work groups whose work has been . temporarily suspended . ? The areas of primary focus for the near term are the . congestion model and work on suspension of existing transmission agreements . among Filing Utilities and the corresponding transfer payments and conversion . of rights . ? Those working ? in these areas may schedule additional meetings . in April as needed . ? There will be ? one additional area of work during April , . which will involve taking an integrated approach to dealing with issues . around tort liability , commercial liability , and credit worthiness and . credit risk . ? Gary Dahlke sent out an e - mail ? on this topic some weeks ago . to the people who participated in the Stage 1 work on the Agreement . Limiting Liability . ? So far there are no scheduled meetings ? for this . additional work effort , but we expect there will be some meetings scheduled . during the month of April . . ? . Please be assured that the areas in which work is being temporarily . suspended ? will be addressed ; it is just a matter of marshalling everyone's . resources in the near term to the most critical tasks . . ? . Thank you all very much for your helpful comments and suggestions . . ? . - Sarah Dennison - Leonard , . ? on behalf of the RTO West Stage 2 Coordinating Team

My office email experience hasn't gone without some gliches . I told Armin . that something really strange must be going on because I was getting emails . from some of you and not from all of you . I told him it seemed like some of . my emails were , in fact , MUST be missing . He blew me off like I didn't know . what I was doing ( which is mostly correct ) . BUT that's beside the point , . then last night after dinner he confessed that his office computer was . probably taking my emails before I got a chance to download them ! The . thief ! So if I seemed to be ignoring some of your emails that's because I . wasn't getting them . Armin had his on automatic download , I made him turn . that off . . . THIS IS MY TURF ! Now I will received all emails first . Write . me !
Well , Armin made it back all in one piece from his ski trip . He said that . it was a good trip , but the sun didn't shine the whole time . He said that . the hotel was full of Americans ! And that most of the service people in the . area were either Canadian or American . They didn't even speak the language , . only english . . . which is no problem for Armin now . ( The language in . Switzerland is supposed to be german so he was ok either way ! ) . He brought back a brochure , but forgot to take the camera . It looks . beautiful ! We all have to go sometime . . . even the brochure was in german and . english . It was just 6 hour drive from here too . Of course , It was only . like 4 to Austria and I liked it really well and it was cheaper . . We had a blizzard here while armin was gone . About 1 foot of snow in 24 . hours . Angus and I made a snowman bottom . We couldn't pick up the second . ball to make a man . I have never seen snow stick like this did . I made a . small ball with my hand at the table in the garden and rolled it up to the . door and back ( that's like a total of 12 feet ) . . . there was nothing but grass . left where I had rolled it and the ball was bigger than I could reach . around ! I hope that was the last snow of the year ! I'M READY FOR SUMMER . AND VACATION ! ! ! . Hope you all had a great weekend ! . Love , . Connie , Armin and ANgus

Stan , . It seems that the gas pipeline industry and the liquid industry may . not agree on an approach to the pipeline safety reauthorization bill and a . rule . making that is being issued concerning pipeline integrity testing . We admit . that . the liquid industry is """" under the gun """" to some degree due to the tragic . incident . at Bellingham last year , and that there is some spillover to the gas side as a . result . However , we think that it is in our interest and the time is right for . us to get something done in this Congress and that we need to """" be for . something """" . that is workable and will also pass . So we're not for a bill at all costs , . but . we are willing to work with Rich Felder and the others at OPS to get to . something we can live with . The integrity rule making will only apply to . liquids . in the first phase and we think we should not oppose this attempt . . We have heard that INGAA may try to kill the reauthorization bill ; I don't . know . if that's true or not , but AOPL is urging them not to panic and see what can . be . worked out . I'll give you a call later next week to tell you exactly where we . are after I talk to Ben Cooper , Executive Director of AOPL in Washington .
As you can see by the attached memo , we have slightly diffferent . interpretations of what the committee members agreed to . However , the . direction is still positive . . -

I wanted to report that since meeting with the Crossroads folks in May they . have owed us information which would allow us to place a new valuation on the . Crossroads acquisition . They have called in twice to ask for more time to . provide the information . Since we have been focusing our attention on Wyoming . and Alberta deals we did not object to their delay . . This week Dan Gavito called in and left the message that in a few days we . might see an announcement that the utility , NIPSCO and the new pipeline . Vector have concluded a deal where NIPSCO will take short haul capacity on . Vector ( to Indiana ) and that Vector will interconnect with Crossroads . Dan . called to emphasize that this deal with Vector would have NO impact on . Crossroads continuing conversations with NBP to buy a share in Crossroads .

I just wanted to recap our 2000 Earnings Target , based upon our discussions . on Wednesday . . 1999 Consolidated Net Income $ 49 . 6 Million . 2000 Target Consolidated Net Income $ 96 . 6 Million . ( Included original """" stretch """" of $ 2 . 9M ) . 2000 Base Operating Income Target $ 147 . 4 Million . 2000 Current Estimate Base Operating Income $ 154 . 8 Million . Through June of 2000 , in our Base Operating Income we were able to cover our . original stretch of $ 2 . 9Million , . as well as a Sale of Assets shortfall of $ 2 . 6 Million , resulting in our . exceeding our Base Operating Income Target . by a net amount of $ 1 . 9 Million . . We will now put into place a plan to cover the incremental stretch of at . least $ 2 . 9 Million for 2000 . Our revised 2000 Consolidated Net Income Target . is now $ 89 . 4 Million . We will be meeting in the next few days to develop and . implement our strategy to attain this target . I will advise you of the . possibilities which we will be pursuing to reach our . target . . You should also recall that we are continuing to pursue reimbursement for our . costs related to the lowering of the Black . Marlin pipeline across the Houston Ship Channel . The Purchase and Sale . Agreement for Black Marlin was . negotiated such that all dollars collected for that work will come back to . Enron as income . . In the final analysis , I am confident that we will meet , or exceed , the . target before us . If you have any questions , or wish to discuss any of this , . please call me .
Stan - FYI , we ( Ron , John , Rod , Saeed and Dwight ) had a great meeting today . with PWC to discuss getting a better handle on both the operating synergies . and growth potential for a combination pipes / wires Transco . They had a very . good outline of how to move forward at a 50 , 000 foot level , which is . appropriate for our next meetings on 2 / 1 / and 2 / 4 . The action items . resulting were as follows : . ENE to provide PWC w / basic data download from our work in progress . ( assumptions we've used for the IOU's assets , GPG public data , shell models , . etc . ) ( 1 / 21 ) . PWC to provide ENE cost to complete study prior to 2 / 1 and 2 / 4 meetings ( 1 / 21 ) . PWC to provide ENE a template for evaluating each of the synergies we . mutually agreed need focusing on now . ( 1 / 24 ) . PWC to provide ENE a similar template for the various growth prospects . discussed ( 1 / 24 ) . Initial follow up meeting ( same participants from ENE ) on Monday , 1 / 24 to . begin rationalizing the data and quantifying the numbers . . Rough draft of study due before 2 / 1 meeting . . Final draft prior to 2 / 4 meeting . . As always , call if any questions . . RANDY
Jim , . Just wanted to pass along some information that I have received within the . last week . It is my understanding , from two separate reliable sources in the . environmental community in Florida that the round of FERC held meetings . related to gathering comments on the """" Draft Environmental Impact Statements """" . ( DEIS ) were widely different between the Gulfstream Project and the Buccaneer . Project . Their comments are summarized as follows : . Gulfstream Project . - Meetings held at four separate locations . - No more than a total of 25 people attended any one meeting . Groups was . cordial and quiet . . - Only 4 or 5 people spoke and had no negatives about Gulfstream . Main . comments related to pipeline safety and the Carlsbad incident . . Buccaneer Project . - Meetings held at four separate locations . - In Pasco County Meeting - 300 people attended with some picket lines . formed outside the meeting place . 150 speakers signed up to speak and . were all protesting the siting of the pipeline in Pasco County . Many of . the landowners said that they would never sign an agreement with Buccaneer . and they would fight the line . . - Remainder of meetings were relatively benign with minor protests ( about 6 . to 10 speakers at each ) . . The Third Party Environmental Contractor working for the FERC on the EIS . commented to me last week that he thought the Final EIS would be out by the . end of the year on both projects . He said that both ( he thought ) would be . approved with more environmental and landowner conditions in the Buccaneer . order than for Gulfstream . . Again , this is shared as an """" FYI """" . I hope it helps . John Shafer
Attached is the most current release . The second paragraph has been changed . to reflect the comments made at the 10 : 45 AM meeting .

Here is a revised version of the Red Rock agreement which includes changes suggested by Jeff . If you've already sent the previous version to shippers , that is perfectly fine , as Jeff's changes should be noncontroversial . We've just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper's bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement . This new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion .

Here it is with the contract number .
Today's technical conference ( RP00 - 336 ) was not the snazzy show we perhaps expected . With El Paso having done 5 studies on different allocation scenarios , shippers requested four more , showing seasonalization impacts and the difference between CD and Full Requirements shipper Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks . . Though there were some FR vs . CD shippers discussions , they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by . the TX , NM and AZ FR shippers and Aera Energy ( CD shippers ) . There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service . . The primary issue here ended up being procedural , with the decision still up in the air if this should be set for hearing or a merits decision from the Commission ( or settlement , though that seems very likely - - merits decision is the most likely case ) . . Also never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants proposals that El Paso dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or requiring mainline system expansion for existing service ( RP01 - 484 and 486 ) . . The procedural schedule has been set : . El paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing : Sept . 24 . Initial comments ( on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations ) : Oct . 15 . Reply comments : Oct . 26 . I'll send a more detailed report , but wanted to get the quick info . out to those most interested .

It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest ! Anytime . . . . The current issue of Texas Monthly is only the beginning . . . right after we announced our current earnings last week , The Wall Street Journal originated a story about a partnership our CFO invested in that made questionable statements about conflicts of interests with the shareholders , non - disclosure of profits , etc . , and have kept up with this story since last week , we have had shareholder lawsuits , SEC inquiries , our stock has taken a dive down to $ 15 today , down from $ 33 when the story first ran , and $ 87 since the beginning of the year . Right now it is beat up Enron time with no end in sight . Anyway , you may to check the WSJ website and catch up . . . . Also , I have a new boyfriend , my old biking buddy I mentioned we've been dating now for a few months , that seems to be going well . So that's all my news . . . . XXOO . - -

Guys . Next week we're planning on recalibrating the dummified regression models ( """" placement models """" ) built earlier this year and last for the Enron Credit pricing system . These basically have the objective of predicting a 5 - yr CDS price for an illiquid name , based on available data . This data consists of : . Credit Ratings , Outlook and Watch . Equity based data - eg , EDF , 90d Volatility , Beta , Market Cap , Dividend yield , PE ratio . Financial ratios - eg , EBITDA interest coverage , Current ratio , EPS , Debt to Assets . Descriptive Info - Country and Industry . I've outlined the methodology used for the models thus far in the attached docs : . We're kicking off this effort next week with a brainstorming session with the trading desk , to outline areas of deficiency and proposed model improvements . From the quantitative side we'd appreciate greatly if any or all of you could read these docs and offer any suggestions for improvement of the models . Any ideas on statistical techniques or the overall methodology will be welcome . I'd also be happy to set up meetings or just talk on the phone if any further explanation is required . . Regards .

I recently met with John Sherriff to review year - to - date regulatory affairs . costs . We both agreed my team's efforts represent a real bargain ! . Seriously , John asked me to summarise year - to - date spend for the commercial . units , so that they might get a feel for the costs being incurred on their . behalf . I do this below . First , just few explanations . First , these are . figures through July ( 7 months ) . Our burn rate is fairly constant , so you . should be able to extrapolate year - end spend from these , with the exception . of Central and Southeastern Europe , which started high and has come down . . Second , direct costs ( payroll , travel , consultants , etc . ) incurred by my . department year - to - date are $ 2 . 27 million . Overhead allocations in ( IT , . Admin . , HR , etc . ) , which are included in your figures below , represent $ 2 . 36 . million . Finally , there is a little bit of """" noise """" still in these numbers , . e . g . , my cost centre , for some reason , is picking up a large share of all . Amsterdam payroll costs , even though I only have one person in that office . . The figures below are not intended to be all inclusive , and therefore will . not necessarily add up $ 4 . 63 million . Please feel free to contact me should . you have any questions . . German - speaking origination $ 482 , 000 . Nordic market 43 , 500 . Poland 326 , 500 . Russia 7 , 000 . Coal Trading 39 , 500 .

There may be some press today about Enron's involvement in the Nepal hydro . project . The government of Nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it , but we . are not going to . Kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are . not pursuing the project . Kelly will also be getting in touch with David . Howe . I just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting . questions .
Attached are FERC reports
Don't worry about it . . . sorry for putting you back on speaker . I just . wanted Sue to hear ( she enjoys utility bashing so much ) . Thanks for the . comment on the hearing . In some respects I don't think the first panel could . have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for . different reasons ) . The other staff reports are also looking good . Scott . Miller has been a godsend - - somebody not afraid to tell it like it is . . Jeff Dasovich .

Steve : We had an outstanding kidk off meeting in Houston and then two . additional meetings of declining participation . We have copied the Enron WTO . Working Group on various e - mails but other than Geneen Migden and of course . Rick Shapiro in his supervisory role have had no input except from Chris and . Steve . Steve has been communicating directly with EBS on the growing . e - commerce and audio visual aspects of the WTO services negotiation launch . which we are anticipating in the spring . We now have concerns in the . financial services area ( trading ) which may be emerging . I copied our . Washington group this morning on a confidential ISAC 13 document I received . yesterday which Bob Fisher recommended that we examine closely regarding . financial services . . I think a WTO task force continues to have merit but perhaps should be . staffed by people from EBS , Enron's financial services people , perhaps a Tom . Briggs and chaired by Linda if you see the growing aspects of our work on WTO . services . We also need the help of our trade professional Bob Fisher .

At the close of our very productive meeting yesterday , I promised to . circulate a brief update on California's electricity demand trends ; it . appears below as an attachment at the close of a note I circulated . within NRDC earlier today , which I thought would be of interest : . Today should have been a severe test for the California grid : we had . the third straight day of high temperatures throughout much of the state . and the Southwest ( weather forecasts earlier in the week had prompted . warnings of rolling blackouts ) . As I write this at 4 pm on Thursday , . average temperatures throughout the entire PG & E system are above 90 . degrees . But peak loads for the day will not reach 40 , 000 Megawatts , . and reserve margins are comfortable ( about 15 % at the peak hour ) . . California's last rolling blackouts occurred six weeks ago ( and those . were very modest in scale ) . It is far too soon to declare victory , but . these are hopeful signs , and they will help relieve pressure on the . Governor to crank up dirty emergency generators . NRDC's updated . assessment of recent CA electricity consumption trends ( attached again . just in case you've lost it ) indicates that demand reductions clearly . are a big part of the reason why things are looking up . There are . plenty of reasons for continued caution : the entire West can get much . hotter , hydropower conditions in the Northwest remain awful , and . complacency could shift demand back up quickly ( much of the recent load . reductions represent reversible voluntary actions ) . . You can track the daily drama in detail at . http : / / www . caiso . com / outlook . html . . - californiaconsumptiontrendsrevised . doc
I'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever . Having duties related to . setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on . the Hill , will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those . duties , not just those related specifically to her substantive area . I think . it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting , . rather than directing , others in the organization . . Richard Shapiro . 08 / 02 / 2000 04 : 17 PM
House Speaker Hastert has decided to close the entire Capitol complex , . including the office buildings on the House side , at the end of the working . day today through Monday , as a precautionary move to allow for special . agents and germ experts to conduct a sweep of the ventilation systems and . all remaining unopened mail . The Senate side is expected to do the same . . It has also been confirmed that the anthrax - laden letter sent to Senate . majority leader Daschle's office was of a particularly potent , high grade . military quality anthrax that quickly spread once opened . Some 29 staff in . Dachle's office or the mail room have tested positive , and some anthrax . spores were found in the ventilation system of the Hart building ( where . Daschle's office is located ) and in one of the tunnels leading to the . Capitol itself . . If there is even a hint that this military grade anthrax came from Iraq , there . will be a strike by the U . S . against Iraq . Another possibility is that the . anthrax is of Russian origin and was somehow illicitly acquired by Al Qaeda or . the Taliban . . There has not been a second anthrax letter or a new outbreak of anthrax , . nor is there any evidence of anthrax spores spreading to committee rooms . located in the other Senate or House buildings . This was a pre - cautionary . move by House Speaker hastert , though it in no way diminishes how ugly the . situation is .
Threat levels : . DOE is still at Security Condition ( SECON ) 3 modified ( no change from last week ) . . NERC is still at 2 . 5 , ( no change from last week ) . . NRC is still at the highest threat level - 3 ( no change from last week ) . . Threats / Suspicious Activity : . On 10 / 23 , NIPC reported that in the past week , there have been reports of several overflights of plants ( both nuclear and fossil ) . The FAA / FBI process to report overflights of nuclear plants has been streamlined . Operators observing aircraft overflights should have appropriate devices ( such as telescopes , binoculars , etc . ) on hand to obtain the aircraft tail number . Incidents should be reported to the FAA regional offices who will then pass the information to the FBI . . NIPC also reported incidents of """" suspicious behavior """" at plants including surveillance to learn layouts of plants and what is stored at the plants . One specific threat against a nuclear facility was apparently reported through local law enforcement , although we have no specific information regarding the location of the plant or the nature of the threat .

I'm not sure . A couple of theories : refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction ; second , in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic ( and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington , it's unlikely to get better soon ) . . In other news : Melissa's mom called last night . Francis is dying . He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver .

John and Louise - . Based on your meeting with Kevin and Dave earlier today , I understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a Texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized . . The below is my best estimate for developing the Brownsville site to get to the monetization point ( permits in hand and EPC contract signed ) . I expect to have both an EPC contract and permits in hand some time around Sep '02 if we start with the expenditures in mid July '01 . Expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $ 350 , 000 per month for the next 12 months . We can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed . . Costs for a Florida site will be similar ; however , expenditures will not start until we achieve site control . . My recommendation is to start fully developing the Brownsville , TX site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit , as market conditions warrant . I recommend holding off on significant expenditures in Florida until we get more comfortable with site control . . Mitch . By 9 / 02 . $ 000's . Option for land lease 	 	 $ 33 . EPC contractor preliminary engineering 	 	 $ 300 . Owner's engineer 	 	 $ 1 , 200 . Permit Filing - Consultant , etc 	 	 $ 800 . Detailed Engineering 	 	 $ 1 , 400 .

Mr . Lay , I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off . today . As you probably already know , the flight from Beijing was a record . first for the GV into Houston . . I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a . total fleet transition at length with John Stabler , Ron Fain and Keith . Jones . I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well . as our thoughts and recommendations . . Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger , Gulfstream is a good . two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size . They have . overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the . program , problems that the Global Express may still be facing . Worldwide . support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the . Global Express . . Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on . your India trip in December . . All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to . support Enron into the new millennium .

Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and . the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation . . Long and short of it is - . Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a . devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy . . Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991 . Large part of the population . remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990 . . To devalue the currency , Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law . - this requires approval of the Federal Congress . . TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the . Convertibility law , it has protection through its license and regulations . . Indeed , as you remembered , the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate . . A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as . changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation , and it is willing . to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then . there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way . delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar . . In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty . . The impact on Enron's P & L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as . the functional currency . If we use the Peso as the functional currency - . Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a . devaluation . If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would . be no impact on our income statement . I will research this further in order . to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency . . Pete

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds , such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH , that benefit the company's employees , who lost their retirement savings , and provide relief to low - income consumers in California , who can't afford to pay their energy bills . Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees . . Indeed , while you netted well over a $ 100 million , many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out .

As a result , there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt . .

Signs of compromise and cooperation emerged from a marathon seven - hour . meeting last night between California government officials , power industry . executives and the Clinton administration on California's continuing energy . crisis . A set of key principles were hammered out by the two dozen . participants , according to a statement issued following the meeting . . The stakeholders agreed on the need for cooperation to """" maintain stability . and avoid bankruptcy of California utilities and assure the long - term . regularity of market conditions . """" The utilities have amassed $ 12 billion in . unrecovered wholesale power costs , and despite the recent approval of new . rate surcharges the utilities remain on the brink of financial insolvency . . The meeting participants agreed on a few crucial elements of a solution to . California's power woes , including the following : development of approaches . to promote long - term purchases of power , possibly by the state , from . generators at an """" attractive fixed rate ; """" the willingness of generators and . qualifying facilities and marketers to provide on a short - term basis .

"""" better match supply and demand ; """" and review of the existing qualifying . facilities payment structures . . Working groups are meeting today in Washington , D . C . to address additional . technical details and the senior policy makers will reconvene this weekend to . complete an agreement . .

In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to . the turbine sale to Delta , attached for your initial review and comment are . drafts of the initial notice to CSFB , an assignment and assumption agreement . and a bill of sale . Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May . 2000 agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the . April 3 , 2001 """" Agreement in Principle """" with GE . Please note , if possible , we . would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by E - Next on the turbines . ( this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial . notice ) . . Lastly , as a background refresher , ENA is effectively selling 4 turbines to . Delta Power as follows . ENA presently owns 100 % of Salmon Energy LLC . Delta . is going to place in escrow the monies owed on 4 turbines ( as well as ENA's . profit on the transaction ) and after such escrow deposit , ENA will then . proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment . and assumption agreement and bill of sale . After these steps have occurred , . then ENA will sell 80 % of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power . At some . future date , ENA's remaining 20 % interest in Salmon will be transferred to .

Attached is a revised book and model per our discussion in the meeting this . morning . Gerald researched the gathering contracts and found that they are . mostly in $ / mmbtu instead of $ / mcf . This knocks down the value of gathering . all the entrada reserves down by about $ 2mm and thus total value is now at . ~ $ 8mm . The value of the Dakota gas is not impacted much .
Here are the reviews I did . . Thanks . . Bob

Yesterday , Jim and I had a discussion with Tom Brown ( Bob Mustard ) and the . potential new owners of the Wildhorse assets . The name of the company is . Cantera Resources , Inc . They have offices in Dallas and Denver . They are a . midstream gathering and processing company , predominately owned by Morgan . Stanley Dean Witter . They recently ( about 9 months ago ) purchased the . processing assets from TXU . The two gentlemen from Cantera on the line were . Dave Kenyon ( Denver ) and Terry Klare ( Dallas ) . . They wanted to know about the Entrada gas and our low - Btu gas plans . We . indicated that we are in the process of building a 24 MMSCFD plant at the . South Canyon interconnect . Also indicated that while the San Arroyo gas was . currently covered under an existing gathering agreement , the Badger Wash gas . was not dedicated . We indicated that we wanted to bring 10mmscfd from San . Arroyo and we could move anywhere from 8 - 15mmscfd from Badger Wash . All . wells are drilled . We did not discuss third party gas . . They indicated they are very interested in working with us on this low - Btu . project . They also indicated that the only way they make money is by moving . gas - as much as possible . . The PSA for the transaction has not been executed at this time . Both . parties indicated they expect to sign the PSA next week , with closing soon . thereafter ( no timeframe given ) . Once the PSA is signed , TBI has no . objections to discussions between Crescendo and Cantera to proceed without . TBI . Dave and Terry indicated they wanted to enter into more serious . discussions with us as soon as the PSA is signed . . Athough Bob did indicate to Cantera that there were issues with the San . Arroyo Gathering Agreement , we did not discuss any of the other issues with . the contract , as the conversation was brief and more of an introduction of . us to them . . Ken Krisa

Welcome to s + b's enews , an exclusive added - value from strategy + business . . This week : How Insurers Will Win the Finance Wars . New York , August 27 , 2001 - The insurance industry is bracing for a tough fight against financial - services companies that are rapidly adding insurance to their product offerings . According to the fourth - annual Booz - Allen & Hamilton eInsurance survey , the Web will be a key battleground . . In mid 2000 , the Booz - Allen survey , which analyzed 206 financial - services sites , found that the top 10 insurance sites attracted 5 million unique visitors per month - versus 10 million for brokerage sites and 18 million for bank sites . As a result , banks and brokerages that sell insurance are getting their marketing messages in front of customers far more often than insurance competitors . . How can insurance companies increase their visibility on the Web to attract and retain more customers ? Booz - Allen & Hamilton's eInsurance survey says more non - insurance products , alliances with financial partners , and useful tools to increase traffic can go a long way in helping insurers get back in the game . .

. Greenfield at Large : Weeknights , 11 : 00 p . m . ET . Wednesday , January 09 , 2002 . . We're dealing today with the possible returns of two . phenomena that may cause some folks to lose sleep - - . anthrax and politics . . Which is worse we'll leave for you to decide . . There's no indication that a bioterror attack is under . way or about to be . Instead , we're focusing tonight on . what happens IF it is . Is the U . S . any better prepared . now than it was in October ? What happened to all the talk . about ensuring that communities are ready to respond ? Has . the money been allocated ? Plans formulated ? We'll ask one . of the top advisors to Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge , . Dr . Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health . . Then there's politics . The November elections and the . ailing economy have - - despite September 11's aftermath of . unity - - led to both parties sharpening their rhetorical . swords . And they're starting to get pulled from their . sheaths more often . This past weekend President Bush and . Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle took aim at each other . . Is this what the country needs right now ? Or is it a . healthy sign of a return to the normal give - and - take of . America's political system ? We'll debate these questions . tonight with Susan Page of USA Today , Slate . com's Jacob . Weisberg and CNN Contributor Jonah Goldberg .

BIPAC endorses candidate for Special Election PA 9 . Pennsylvania 9 Special Election - May 15 , 2001 - Representative Bud Shuster . ( R ) - resigned . Candidates : Bill Shuster ( R ) - son of incumbent , auto dealer . Scott Conklin ( D ) - county commissioner from Centre County . It is time for PACs to gear up and take notice of the special election being . held in PA 9 . . Bill Shuster's pro - business stance results directly from his numerous years . of insight into the business world . For the past decade he has owned a . small business in his district . Prior to owning his own automobile . dealership , he spent years immersed in the auto industry . He worked for a . supplier in Michigan for a number of years , and he also served as regional . manager for Goodyear in the Washington metro area . . In his BIPAC candidate interview , Mr . Shuster proved that he was very . knowledgeable of the issues that are most important to the business . industry . His stance on health care , trade issues , market issues , . environmental regulation , and tax reform all were cohesive to the objectives . business hopes to accomplish in the 107th Congress . . Despite the fact that this should be a landslide win with a Republican . running in a Republican district , you will more than likely see a very . competitive race . There is a weakened Republican base due to competing . factions within the state Republican Party . . Bill Shuster for Congress Committee . www . shuster2001 . com . 227 Allegheny Street , PO Box 27 . Hollidaysburg , PA 16648 - 0272 . Telephone : 1 - 888 - 221 - 2455 or 814 - 696 - 0225 .

Welcome to s + b's enews , an exclusive added - value from srategy + business . . This Week : . Security , Strategy , and the Commercial Enterprise . By Ralph Shrader and Mike McConnell . Washington , November 2 , 2001 - President George W . Bush has confirmed what many of us in business already understood intuitively : The new war on terror will be fought not just by governments and soldiers , but also by the companies , large and small , that comprise the global economy - the terrorists' real target . . """" Terrorists want to turn the openness of the global economy against itself , """" the President told executives attending the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai recently . """" We must not let them . """" . If we are to surmount the grueling test the free world now confronts , we must adapt both national and corporate strategies toward an unfamiliar but absolutely necessary goal : promoting openness and maintaining security at the same time . . Rising to that challenge , though , will not be easy . Our whole way of doing business has long been evolving toward greater openness and more individual empowerment . But as the assaults of September 11 have shown , transparency and empowerment allow technological , political , and social forces , abroad and at home , to threaten us . Yet to withdraw into protectionism , while a natural instinct , will prove far deadlier than Al Qaeda and its associates . .

Notice Number : 01 - 391 . November 21 , 2001 . TO : . ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS . ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS . FROM : . J . Robert Collins , Jr . , President . SUBJECT : . Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants . As a result of the attack on the World Trade Center and the inaccessibility . of the precious metals stored at ScotiaMocatta Depository ( """" SMD """" ) , an . Exchange Licensed Depository , located in Four World Trade Center ( """" 4WTC """" ) , . the NYMEX Board of Directors implemented emergency rules pertaining to the . warrants issued by SMD . In summary , these emergency rules permitted an . individual or firm taking delivery the option to reject a warrant for metal . on deposit at the SMD vault at 4WTC . . SMD has successfully relocated , using an Exchange Approved Carrier , all of . the precious metals stored at 4WTC to an SMD custodial account at the . Brink's Inc Exchange Licensed Depository and has applied to the Exchange to . establish a new Licensed Depository in New York City . . Therefore , the Exchange has , effectively immediately , rescinded the . emergency rules pertaining to the warrants issued by SMD . As a result , the . Exchange Rules relating to warrants are those which were in effect prior to . the declaration of the emergency . . Prior to the establishment of its new facility as an Exchange - licensed . depository , SMD will offer its clients the options of leaving the metal in . storage ; selling it to SMD ; exchanging depository receipts for those of . another Exchange - licensed depository acceptable to ScotiaMocatta , with any . ounce differential cash - settled on the basis of a published price determined . by SMD ; or delivering replacement metal to a mutually agreeable location , in . exchange for the metal at the ScotiaMocatta depository , subject to payment . by the client of the current price differential , as quoted by SMD . . Should you have any questions please contact Thomas LaSala at 212 - 299 - 2897 , . Albert J . Getz at 212 - 299 - 2608 or Nick Galati at 212 - 299 - 2920 .

Atlantic Tropical Development Outlook Issued : 08 : 30 AM Monday October 22 , 2001 Gulf of Mexico / Caribbean Sea : A fairly strong upper - level low over western Cuba is responsible for considerable showers and thunderstorms across the southeastern Gulf through Florida today . Although such non - tropical upper - level features can occasionally develop a surface circulation and acquire tropical characteristics , we do not expect this system to develop into a tropical depression or a storm . However , the upper low will still produce very heavy rainfall across the southern Florida peninsula over the next 24 - 48 hours as it moves slowly northeastward toward the northern Bahamas . Tropical Atlantic : There are two weak tropical waves in the Atlantic , but neither wave shows any signs of organization this morning . Upper - level winds are forecast to remain unfavorable for any tropical development here this week . Chris Hebert

Ted : ENA , formerly Enron Gas Marketing , Inc . , opened a futures account with . Cargill in 1993 . I am advised that there has not been any activity with . Cargill for many months . It appears that we had subaccounts for trading . crude , nat gas , unleaded gas . We do not have any margin residing with . Cargill . . Given our recent discussions regarding inactive equity accounts , I was . wondering if you had given any thought to inactive futures accounts . . As of 5 / 23 / 00 , I see only 13 active futures accounts . The following accounts . appear to be dormant : . ( 1 ) Bank One - I am currently negotiating to open up a margin line . ( 2 ) Cargill . ( 3 ) Daiwa Securities America . ( 4 ) Gerald Inc . ( may have merged or business moved to another firm ) . ( 5 ) Merrill Lynch Futures . ( 6 ) Paine Webber . ( 7 ) OM Stockholm ( paper ) . ( 8 ) Spear , Leeds & Kellogg . Please let me know what action you would like to take , if any , or discuss in . general . Thanks . Sara

Dear PIRA Retainer Client : . European electricity markets are experiencing an unprecedented surge in trading volumes and will be entering new phases of integration and liberalization in the years to come . As barriers to trade rapidly erode among countries , and regional markets emerge , we are witnessing all forms of change in pricing basis , and new areas of power trade are constantly evolving . . With these changes in mind , PIRA Energy Group announces the launching of its new European Electricity Service ( EES ) , an Internet - based Retainer Service that complements PIRA's existing market coverage of European and North American natural gas , North American power , and global oil . . EES provides clients with a robust data base , including detailed information for over 4 , 000 power plants , as well as market insights into the developments of power generation , demand , cross - border trading , and prices . PIRA's reputation for grasping market fundamentals is unrivaled , and EES continues in that tradition by helping clients to analyze how to capture value in the rapidly changing European electricity market . . Clients of EES will benefit from : . 1 . Analysis of major and subtle shifts in market trends , which will impact supply availability , power demand , cross - border trading , and price direction ; . 2 . Opportunities to dig deeply into the rich EES database and reveal key issues influencing both short - and long - term market fundamentals ; . 3 .

November 25 , 2001 . Effective immediately , based on anticipated system operations and . weather conditions , as stated below , TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION , LP . ( Texas Eastern ) is requiring that all customers take immediate and . prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts . to actual deliveries . This system - wide warning is issued as a result of . actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual . deliveries . . Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and . shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation . of the coming winter heating season . At this time , Texas Easterns . storage capacity is approximately 98 % full . As a result , there is . virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system . operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual . imbalances left on the system . . Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas . Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being . left on the system , Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate . with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to . match actual customer takes in the market area . No due pipe gas will be . accepted into the system until further notice . . If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of . gas being left on the system , Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an . operational flow order ( OFO ) requiring actual receipts of gas to match . actual deliveries out of the system , which will be subject to the OFO . non - compliance penalty of $ 25 per dekatherm . In addition and as . provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff , Texas Eastern will take . any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its . system , including , but not limited to , suspension of OBA's . . * * * . NOTE : . Duke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy . . You have received this email because you elected to subscribe .

I am comfortable with the Allegheny credit - my understanding is that they are getting a sweetheart deal on the assets being transferred from their regulated utility so they will be in a buying mode for quite some time - in fact they are a good candidate for buying this but I did not want to disrupt the negotiations by bringing up the equity sale . . Regarding Turbopark , this project on its own could go into Turbopark ( we are using their form of EPC ) , but because this is linked to a Fair Market Value QF , accounting is not comfortable using it ( it risks our favourable Arthur Anderson treatment on all of our FMV assets ) We have assumed in our economics that the bridge loan is priced at 15 % . . The Allegheny toll , and all development contracts are a CP to this deal - this needs to be perfectly nailed down prior to pulling the trigger ! . Louise Kitchen . 04 / 12 / 2001 12 : 59 PM

Amy & Julie - I have sold my house and will be moving to an apt . near Kirby & W . Alabama before the end of the month . I am in the process of packing up my house and have several other obligations this weekend so I will not be able to arrange for the newsletter distribution . I believe I gave Amy a list of the distributors - Deanna will not be able to continue and Martha and Pat have indicated they would like some relief also . On the positive side , Lorraine ( ? ) in the 300 block of Welch ( with the new baby ) has said she would like to help . . I can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor ? . Thanks , . Teb

Good Morning Team , . The Orange County Register will eliminate 102 positions of the newspaper's 1 , 749 full time employees on Friday , as a result of decreased circulation and revenue due to weak advertising compounded by the September attacks . As of March 31 , the Register had a daily circulation of 353 , 334 and a Sunday circulation of 410 , 207 , with an annual NP consumption of 120 , 000 MT . . - - . Media General reported a 3Q01 loss - - its first quarterly loss in 4 years . The terrorist attacks of September 11th had an immediate impact on our earnings , and they have exacerbated the economic uncertainty that has caused many of our advertisers to remain cautious , '' Chief Executive J . Stewart Bryan III said . Revenues for 3Q01 were down 4 % from the same period in 2000 . Media General's publishing division , which includes the Richmond Times - Dispatch and the Tampa Tribune , had a revenue decrease of 5 . 4 % . . - - . Sun Media eliminated 125 more jobs in cost - cutting measures intended to save $ 10 million annually . The Quebecor subsidiary - publisher of such major dailies as the Toronto Sun and Le Journal de Montreal - announced it is combining the business operations of its Bowes Publishing division , which produces over 190 weeklies and community dailies , with those of its metropolitan dailies . As well , it is ending production of its free Toronto commuter daily , FYI Toronto . The end of FYI Toronto should provide some immediate relief to other Toronto dailies , such as the Toronto Star , and possibly increase demand for Toronto dailies . . . . October abounds with job cuts and 3Q01 losses . . . none of this comes as a surprise in light of the bleak ad market and the negative shock of the September attacks . As a result , many publishers are looking to cut costs to recover from decreased ad revenues . If you would like more information on a particular publisher , I would be happy to oblige . . Ayesha

PLEASE FORWARD TO ANYONE APPROPRIATE : . Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation ( the media was in the . room ) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday . afternoon . . He initially talked about """" can bring a horse to water , but can't make him . drink . """" . He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $ 716 . 1MM for Settlement . ( $ 510MM for Duke , Dynegy , Mirant , Williams , Reliant + $ 125MM for Powerex + . $ 49 . 6MM for 15 marketers + $ 6 . 5MM for 6 CMUA members + $ 25MM for outside . Calif Utilities [ includes PGE ] ) . He said thought refunds in the hundred of . $ millions or maybe $ 1billion were right . . His will propose the following method to the Commission . . 1 . Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19 . . 2 . Modify that decision to ( a ) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in . NP15 and SP15 , ( b ) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA , . incorporate NOx costs , add a 10 % credit premium . . 3 . Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to . questions of material facts ( Mwh sold , gas prices , etc ) . . He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset . against CAISO bills . . Importantly , we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC ( a ) . determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are . determined to be J & R , ( b ) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar . refunds , limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out - of - Market . transactions . . We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these . issues to seek clarity . . Finally , is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to . calculate the refund liability ? We may want to understand the risk under . different assumptions . . Thanks , . Jim

CYNET is experiencing a temporary service interruption . of the assigned telephone numbers of it's Inbound Fax - 2 - Email . Service . . Our local loop carrier has advised us they are aware of the situation . and they are working to restore this connectivity . . While CYNET maintains back - up facilities for its Fax - 2 - Email services . the problem we are faced with is that we can not place the same user . telephone number within two different facilities at the same time . Our . technical team is working on future recommendations in the form of . having individual back - up numbers in the event of this type of outage . . We sincerely do apologize for any inconvenience this may . cause you and your users and expect to have this service restored . as soon as possible . . Sincerely , . Robert P . Demyanovich . President & COO . CYNET , Inc . . 12777 Jones Road Suite 400 .

Thursday ) while we get set up in the new house . . . if the download didn't . work and you need a copy to proof , just let me know and I'll swing by with . one in the morning ( our closing is not far from you , Nancy , so it won't be a . problem ) . .

MEMORANDUM . TO : Regulatory Affairs Committee . Gas Issues Working Group . FROM : 	 Jim Steffes , Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair . John Orr , Gas Issues Working Group Chair . Julie Simon , Vice President of Policy . Jack Cashin , Senior Manager of Policy . DATE : 	 11 / 15 / 2001 . RE : EPSA Second Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity . Recall NOPR . ? 	 	 	 Comments due November 19th . ? . As discussed on Wednesday's Conference Call attached are second draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ( NOPR ) on pipeline capacity recall . This draft reflects the changes suggested during the conference call . The following are the major changes from the earlier draft : . 1 . The word """" Opposing """" has been removed from the filing . Rather the filing retains the same arguments but indicates that EPSA has """" concerns """" . . 2 . We added footnote 1 to stress that in no event should the Commission mandate that such recall provisions be included in a recall notice . Rather consistent with the NOPR , such recalls should only be permitted , with the ultimate determination being subject to negotiation between the releasing and replacement shipper . . 3 . We added footnote 3 to recognize that this filing reflects the views of EPSA as an organization , not the views of individual members . . 4 . We added the footnotes missing from the earlier draft . . 5 . We did some minor editing to page 3 , the first full paragraph . The sentence starting with """" This service will be of less value to potential purchasers than any firm service the pipeline could offer . . . . """" and well as the next sentence are slightly different than the earlier draft . . Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin @ epsa . org by close of business on Friday , November 16th so that we can make a timely filing on Monday , November 19th . .

I will mail the checks and money to Barb . There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you . One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip . She said that many people were asking her for it , and if we had room , maybe we could publish it in the newsletter . I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed """" filler """" . Let me know if you do need a filler , and I can send the recipe via an attachment . Feel free to call me at work - 713 - 853 - 5926 . I have the recipe in my briefcase . . Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of ! . At fall regional training , I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information ( from the national website ) to be included in our newsletters . Had planned to drop that off as well . I am still at home right now , but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later . . Thanks again for all of your hard work ! ! ! - - Sally . - -

Exciting news on the house , but I know that you must be busy ! When we moved to Champion Forest , we did the same thing . Called the real estate agent to list our house on a Monday , got a contract on our house on Tuesday , and put a contract on our new house on Wednesday that week . You and your husband must be into quick decision making as well ! ! . Yes , life at Enron is interesting these days . Kind of like a soap opera . Difficult for everyone to stay focused . We are ready for some good news here . . With your move , let me know how I can help more with this December newsletter . It is on my list for the weekend to recreate Lori Ewalt's article as a word attachment and get that to you . I am glad that you have the permission slip in hand . - - Sally . - -

Steve Willbanks . 1555 Hwy . 9 bypass . Morrilton , AR 72110 - 0092 . swillbanks @ communityserviceinc . com . To Mr . Ken Lay , . I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds , such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH , that benefit the company's employees , who lost their retirement savings , and provide relief to low - income consumers in California , who can't afford to pay their energy bills . Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees . . Indeed , while you netted well over a $ 100 million , many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out . And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year . As a result , there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt . . The New York Times reported that you sold $ 101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it . Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings . . Sincerely , . Steve Willbanks
